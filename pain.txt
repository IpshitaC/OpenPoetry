he used pressure to stop the bleeding
at the pressing of a button
he watched the impression of the seal on the hot wax
he gave the door a shove
she complained about bundling the children off to school
elbowing is a foul in basketball
the pull up the hill had him breathing harder
his strenuous pulling strained his back
the drag up the hill exhausted him
the haul up the hill went very slowly
the truck gave him a tow to the garage
his leg was in traction for several days
he responded with a lift of his eyebrow
fireman learn several different raises for getting ladders up
the belching of smoke from factory chimneys
he advanced in a series of jumps
the jumping was unexpected
he took a header into the shrubbery
the wailing and jumping up and down exhausted him
the quarterback fumbled the snap
