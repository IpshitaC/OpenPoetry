his claim on her attentions
his title to fame
give the devil his due
the chairman granted him the floor
authority for the program was renewed several times

he maintained an open door for all employees
a strong legal claim to the property
he had no documents confirming his title to his father's estate

a fine opera in its own right
entitlements make up the major part of the federal budget
American women got the vote in 1920
he was elected to a seat in the Senate
we were given the use of his boat
