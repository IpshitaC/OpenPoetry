his assignment verged on the impossible
the instructor took the soft option and gave the boy a passing grade
the rationale for capital punishment
the principles of internal-combustion engines
the whole argument rested on a basis of conjecture
successful negotiation is the meat and potatoes of arbitration
the key to development is economic integration
his planning for retirement was hindered by several uncertainties
they made arrangements to meet in Chicago
I got an upgrade to first class when coach class was full
it was the deliberation of his act that was insulting
their pottery deserves more research than it has received
it was an experiment in living
not all experimentation is done in laboratories
the control condition was inappropriate for the conclusions he wished to draw
a sample for ten days free trial
a trial of progesterone failed to relieve the pain
he stated his political testament
there was a congressional probe into the scandal
an estimate of what it would cost
