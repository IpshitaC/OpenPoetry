a flaw caused the crystal to shatter
if there are any defects you should send it back to the manufacturer
he shot holes in my argument
a stylist noted for the lameness of his plots
drugs have become a sickness they cannot cure
a great sickness of his judgment
whatever my fortune may be
deserved a better fate
has a happy lot
the luck of the Irish
a victim of circumstances
success that was her portion
enjoy the blessings of peace
a spanking breeze is a boon to sailors
it was a mercy we got out alive
the strength of the company's stock in recent weeks
the weakness of the dollar against the yen
he is enjoying great success
he does not consider wealth synonymous with success
the inventor worked for years before hitting pay dirt
