a recrudescence of racism
a recrudescence of the symptoms
come back after the rush
they tried to stop the escape of gas from the damaged pipe
he had to clean up the leak
superfetation is normal in some animal species
he heard the flush of a toilet
there was a little gush of blood
she attacked him with an outpouring of words
the destruction of the building produced an enormous debris surge
from the bow she stared at the mesmerising onrush of the sea where it split and foamed
the explosion interrupted the wild onrush of her thoughts
he rose on the springtide of prosperity
the plane made three rotations before it crashed
the revolution of the earth about the sun takes one year
wheels in axial rotation
satellites in orbital rotation
he was caught up in a whirl of work
a commotion of people fought for the exits
a good wallow in the water
