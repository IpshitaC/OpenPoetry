Congress shall have power to provide for calling forth the militia"--United States Constitution
friendlies came to their rescue
the platoon ran into a pack of hostiles
500 horse led the attack
the strike was supported by the union rank and file
he rose from the ranks to become a colonel
a great assortment of cars was on display

a witches' brew of gangsters and terrorists
mixing dope and alcohol creates a witches' brew

he was impressed by the range and diversity of the collection
the store carried a large selection of shoes
Roosevelt created an alphabet soup of federal agencies
he bought the whole schmeer
they polled their membership
