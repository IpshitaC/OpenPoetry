a building of vast proportions
it was on the order of a mile
an explosion of a low order of magnitude
the signal contained thousands of bits of information
the probability that an unbiased coin will fall with the head up is 0.5
the concept of exceedance can be applied to any type of environmental risk modeling
a moderate grade of intelligence
a high level of care is required
it is all a matter of degree
a coarse grind of coffee
murder in the second degree
a second degree burn
the depth of my feeling
the profoundness of the silence
the glibness of a high-pressure salesman
he wears a size 13 shoe
a number 13 shoe
responsible for the highness of the rates
summer temperatures reached an all-time high
the stock market fell to a new low
