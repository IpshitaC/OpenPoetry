the iron interests stepped up production
we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex"--Dwight David Eisenhower
she invited the whole mishpocha
all his kith and kin
he wanted to have a good job before starting a family
his family has lived in Massachusetts since the Mayflower
he wrote to his folks every day
his people have been farmers for generations
are your people still alive?
he wrote his homefolk every day
the House of York
he had no sons and there was no one to carry on his name
the entire building complained about the noise
the working class
an emerging professional class
members of the fringe believe we should be armed with guns at all times
a congregation of children pleaded for his autograph
a great congregation of birds flew over
each nation sent a contingent of athletes to the Olympics
the whole floor complained about the lack of heat
