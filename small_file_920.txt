for actors, memorizing lines is no game
for him, life is all fun and games
his shtik made us laugh
the parody was just a form of teasing
in the South a snipe hunt is practically a rite of passage
they exchange pleasantries
the celebration of marriage
a drama festival
the children always love to go to the circus
a remarkable show of skill
she made a parade of her sorrows
the museum had many exhibits of oriental art
the presentation of new data
he gave the customer a demonstration
he confused the enemy with feints and demonstrations
a remarkable exhibition of musicianship
the debunking of religion has been too successful
the exposure of his anger was shocking
the appellate court demanded the production of all documents
she did a strip right in front of everyone
