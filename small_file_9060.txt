she sent unruly pupils to see the principal
our prisoner was just a private and knew nothing of value
the procurer of opera tickets
she is a chess prodigy
workers of the world--unite!
untouched by the pruner's axe
David is called The Psalmist because he is believed to be the author of the Book of Psalms
Hermes was their psychopomp
he resigned because his boss used him as a punching bag
the film jumped back and forth from the pursuer to the pursued
always before he had been able to outwit his pursuers
a pursuer of truth
the tournament was won by a late qualifier
he dropped a word in the right quarter
Paris is the queen of cities
the queen of ocean liners
she soaks up foreign languages like a sponge
in England they call a real estate agent a land agent
a rectifier of prejudices
the patient is a referral from Dr. Bones
