a nuclear holocaust
he risked his fortune on a throw of the dice
with a flip of the wrist
the fish flipped over
the next morning they carried out a strafe of enemy airfields
he believed in the manumission of the slaves
the surgery was performed on his second admission to the clinic
the surgery was performed on his readmission to the clinic
scientists will not believe an experimental result until they have seen at least one replication
it has all the earmarks of a Mafia hit
the British colonization of America
the winnowing was done by women
the separation of wheat from chaff
the separation of mail by postal zones
the lead was in the dummy
his leadership inspired the team
the President is at the helm of the Ship of State
he takes the lead in any group
we were just waiting for someone to take the lead
they didn't follow our lead
