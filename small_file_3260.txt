it gave me a nostalgic vibe
the quality of students has risen
an executive of low caliber
the inn is distinguished by the fineness of its cuisine
the ultimate in luxury
the grandness of the architecture
impressed by the richness of the flora
the expansiveness of their extravagant life style was soon curtailed
a plot of great ingenuity
the cleverness of its design
she was unrecognizable because of the poorness of the photography
the scrawniness of sickly trees
he has compiled a record second to none in its wretchedness
his acting was one of the high points of the movie
he knows my bad points as well as my good points
a leader in the mold of her predecessors
her love of music remains her one saving grace
her sense of humor has to be a saving grace
the saving grace for both developments is that they are creating jobs
the changeableness of the weather
