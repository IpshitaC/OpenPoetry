he took his leave
parting is such sweet sorrow
the withdrawal of French troops from Vietnam
the religious retreat is a form of vacation activity
his abandonment of his wife and children left them penniless
students making aliyah
the pullback is expected to be over 25,000 troops
the disorderly retreat of French troops
MacArthur staged a massive amphibious landing behind enemy lines
he made his escape from the mental hospital
the canary escaped from its cage
his flight was an indication of his guilt
the breakout was carefully planned
the thieves made a clean getaway
after the expose he had to take it on the lam
the victory was the realization of a whole year's work
the attainment of independence
he tied the Olympic record
coffee production last year broke all previous records
Chicago set the homicide record
