the presence of bacterial infection was an indication for the use of antibiotics
a manifestation of disease
some previous reader had covered the pages with dozens of marks
paw prints were everywhere
she applied the paint in careful strokes
He drew a line on the chart
just sign on the dotted line
the ruler had 16 graduations per inch
he caught only a glimpse of the professor's meaning
with all that smoke there must be a fire somewhere
they could hear the burglar alarm a mile away
the whistle signalled the end of the game
she started to speak but he gave her the high sign
keep your nose out of it
he learned to write the numerals before he went to school
don't forget the minus sign
he studied the score of the sonata
she turned the pages of the music as he played
his answer was just a punctuation mark
as he called the role he put a check mark by each student's name
