he lived in the wild
they collected mushrooms in the wild
that's the way it is
I felt the same way
a remarkable degree of frankness
at what stage are the social sciences?
he climbed the career ladder
his landscapes were deemed the acme of beauty
the artist's gifts are at their acme
at the height of her career
the peak of perfection

the summit of his ambition
so many highest superlatives achieved by man
at the top of his profession
the extent of the damage
the full extent of the law
to a certain extent she was right
they enjoyed the highest standard of living in the country
