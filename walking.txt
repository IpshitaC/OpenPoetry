the hunter's approach scattered the geese
he gained access to the building
he got his job through the back door
the ship's rapid rate of closing gave them little time to avoid a collision
the army made a push toward the sea
the general had had a distinguished career
he had a long career in the law
the march of science
the march of time
after we solved that problem the rest was plain sailing
walking is a healthy form of exercise
the hospital encouraged early ambulation
he followed on foot
the swiftest of foot
he took a walk after lunch
he walked with unsteady steps
he heard the trip of women's feet overhead
she enjoys a hike in her spare time
he walked with a kind of saunter as if he hadn't a care in the world
ducks walk with a waddle
