the explosion was heard a mile away
he heard footsteps on the porch
the performers could not be heard over the hissing of the audience
the howl of the wind made him restless
the hum of distant traffic
the jingle of coins
the jangle of spurs
the knocking grew louder
he enjoyed the street noises
they heard indistinct noises of people talking
during the firework display that ended the gala the noise reached 98 decibels
the patter of mice
the patter of tiny feet
she missed the pitter-patter of little feet around the house
the death rattle
they heard a violent report followed by silence
the distinctive ring of the church bell
the ringing of the telephone
the tintinnabulation that so voluminously swells from the ringing and the dinging of the bells"--E. A. Poe
they heard the rumbling of thunder
