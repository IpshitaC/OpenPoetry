black lost the exchange
they say that three moves equal one fire
they did a moonlight flit
the plane went into a steep bank
he would stoop to any device to win a point
it was a great sales gimmick
a cheap promotions gimmick for greedy businessmen
he played a trick on me
he pulled a fast one and got away with it
how did you ever fall for a shtik like that?
she needs some fancy footwork to cover all those lies
a means of control
an example is the best agency of instruction
the true way to success
hard work was his escape from worry
they installed a second hatch as an escape
their escape route
they saw independence as the fast track to democracy
he took a fast track to the top of the corporate ladder
the company went off the fast track when the stock market dropped
