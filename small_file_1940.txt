a political gesture
a gesture of defiance
she tried to win his heart with her many attentions
his deference to her wishes was very flattering
be sure to give my respects to the dean
pay court to the emperor
he paid his last respects by standing quietly at the graveside
I have to give my props to the governor for the way he handled the problem
they demanded the right of assembly
mobilization of the country's economic resources
the bell was a signal for the rallying of the whole neighborhood
his meeting with the salesmen was the high point of his day
a filming session
a gossip session
there was too much socialization with the enlisted men
a visit to the dentist
he wanted to hear all about my flying visit to his old stamping grounds
he dropped by for a visit
the turnout for the rally
in return we gave them as good as we got
