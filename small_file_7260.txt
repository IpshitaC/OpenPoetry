an Englishman would interrupt a war to have his afternoon tea
dinner will be at 8
on Sundays they had a large dinner when they returned from church
a ten-minute coffee break
the British have tea breaks
a banquet for the graduating seniors
the Thanksgiving feast
they put out quite a spread
the helpings were all small
his portion was larger than hers
there's enough for two servings each
take a taste--you'll like it
all they had left was a bit of bread
a sup of ale
a vegetable plate
the blue plate special
she made gravy with a base of beef stock
in England they call takeout food `takeaway'
the business decided to concentrate on confectionery and soft drinks
you can break a tooth on that hard candy
