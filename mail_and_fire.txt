his shooting was slow but accurate
they hold a shoot every weekend during the summer
two runners started before the gun
a twenty gun salute
the gunfire endangered innocent bystanders
they retreated in the face of withering enemy fire
her fingers came in contact with the light switch
he gave the hood a quick rub
repeated hitting raised a large bruise
after three misses she finally got a hit
the bruise resulted from a contusion
his crash through the window
the fullback's smash into the defensive line
he goes south every winter for the golfing
he worked the pitcher for a base on balls
they did their best
it was the worst he had ever done on a test
