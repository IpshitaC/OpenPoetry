both teams scored in the first quarter
the Reign of the Bourbons ended and the Reign of Terror began
during the reign of Henry VIII
he was helpless under the reign of his egotism
the assembly line was on a 12-hour run
the world of today
today we have computers
yesterday's solutions are not good enough
we shared many yesterdays
there was a wedding in the offing
tomorrow's world
everyone hopes for a better tomorrow
the dancers moved in time with the music
my ear will not accept such violent accelerandos
they got an early start
she knew from the get-go that he was the man for her
during the youth of the project
things were quiet during the Eisenhower administration
the middle of the war
rain during the middle of April
