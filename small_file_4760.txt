in retrospect
a good executive must be good at decision making
the determination of grammatical inflections
they finally reached a settlement with the union
they never did achieve a final resolution of their differences
he needed to grieve before he could achieve a sense of closure
he had second thoughts about his purchase
he was my pick for mayor
he serves at the pleasure of the President
that book is one of my favorites
what option did I have?
there no other alternative
my only choice is to refuse
the obverse of this issue
given my druthers, I'd eat cake
it was his last wish
they should respect the wishes of the people
if I had my way
bankruptcy is always a possibility
politics is the art of the possible
