he was famous for the truth of his portraits
he turned to religion in his search for eternal verities
he tested for the presence of radon
the inherence of polysemy in human language
things are really there...capture the thereness of them"--Charles Hopkinson
a disease of frequent occurrence
the occurrence (or presence) of life on other planets
he received little recognition working in the shadow of his father
his head was in the clouds
argument could not determine its truth or falsity
he was surprised by the absence of any explanation
he hoped for a new life in Australia
he wanted to live his own life without interference from others
while there's life there's hope
life depends on many chemical and physical processes
he tried to save his skin
farming is a hard means of subsistence
he seemed more content in death than he had ever been in life
she was laid to rest beside her husband
they had to put their family pet to sleep
