the vileness of his language surprised us
he questioned the tenability of my claims
he accepted the naturalness of death
the spontaneous naturalness of his manner
the simple sincerity of folk songs
the spontaneity of his laughter
I am never at ease with strangers
don't put on airs with me
the pursuit of electoral palatability
the unexpectedness of the warm welcome
some words in her dialect had a charming quaintness
ethnicity has a strong influence on community status relations
the strangeness of a foreigner
he loved the exoticism of Egypt
he was beginning to doubt the accuracy of his compass
the lawyer questioned the truth of my account
the atomic clock enabled scientists to measure time with much greater accuracy
he demanded exactness in all details
a man of great exactitude
he examined the essay with the greatest minuteness
