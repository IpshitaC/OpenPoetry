the scrape of violin bows distracted her
he ducked at the screechings of shells
he heard the scream of the brakes
the clash of swords and the shrilling of trumpets"--P. J. Searles
she heard the sigh of the wind in the trees
servants appeared at the snap of his fingers
the song of bullets was in the air
the song of the wind
the wheels sang their song as the train rocketed ahead
he heard a spatter of gunfire
he heard a splat as it hit the floor
she awoke to the squawk of chickens
the squawk of car horns
the squeak of shoes on powdery snow
the strum of a guitar
a soft susurrus of conversation
he heard the tapping of the man's cane
the throbbing of the engines
he could hear the thrum of a banjo
the basketball made a thunk as it hit the rim
