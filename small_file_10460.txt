he practiced the immurement of his enemies in the castle dungeon
his detention was politically motivated
the prisoner is on hold
he is in the custody of police
he was held in solitary
an person who has been declared incompetent should have legal representation
seeking complete political separateness for Taiwan
there is a tension created between narrative time and movie time
there is a tension between these approaches to understanding history
a hormonal imbalance
they were in a state of steady motion
the shaking of his fingers as he lit his pipe
a stream of people emptied from the terminal
the museum had planned carefully for the flow of visitors
the utter motionlessness of a marble statue
strengthened by rootage in the firm soil of faith
his sphere of activity
he is out of action
the agency of providence
she has free agency
