she did an outstanding job as Ophelia
he gave it up as a bad job
the operations in building a house
certain machine tool operations
salvation by deeds
the reward for good works
budget separately for goods and services
a cell phone with internet facility
the shining of shoes provided a meager living
every Sunday he gave his car a good polishing
he charged a dollar for a shoeshine
the cost of utilities never decreases
all the utilities were lost after the hurricane
the boss hoped the plan would succeed but he wasn't willing to do the heavy lifting
efficient housecleaning should proceed one room at a time
more housecleaning is in store at other accounting firms
many employees were discharged in a general housecleaning by the new owners
while he was waiting he filled the days with busywork
he's not in my line of business
he missed the bell in his occupation with the computer game
