the economy has been on a roller coaster all year
the sea hurled itself in thundering rage against the rocks
he could sense her latent hostility to him
the diplomats' first concern was to reduce international tensions
his conflict of interest made him ineligible for the post
a conflict of loyalties
her dress was a disturbing clash of colors
war was declared in November but actual fighting did not begin until the following spring
he tried to shield me from suspicion
after that mistake he was under a cloud
they played as long as it was light
as long as the lighting was good
it vanished into the night
they fumbled around in total darkness
in the black of night
it is much cooler in the shade
there's too much shadiness to take good photographs
he struck a match to dispel the gloom
his emotional state depended on her opinion
he was in good spirits
