political fatigue
his hopes were so high he was doomed to disappointment
in spite of his troubles he never gave up hope
they moaned in despair and dismay
one harsh word would send her into the depths of despair
his love for his work
children need a lot of love
their devotion to each other was beautiful
he had trouble expressing the affection he felt
the child won everyone's heart
the warmness of his welcome made us feel right at home
she mistook his manly regard for love
he inspires respect
she had a soft spot for her youngest son
many adoption cases tug at the heartstrings
he could no longer contain his hostility
the chief is on the warpath today
his promotion caused much heartburning among his rivals
holding a grudge
settling a score
