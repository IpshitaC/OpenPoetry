the house was in a terrible state of neglect
she searched the table for omissions
in the twilight of the empire
the house was a wreck when they bought it
thanks to that quack I am a human wreck
the inn was a renovation of a Colonial house
to everyone's surprise, parenthood reformed the man
an island in the embrace of the sea
the association should get rid of its elderly members--not by euthanasia, of course, but by Coventry
lumber of the highest grade
always a step behind
subtle gradations in color
keep in step with the fashions
he is a cut above the rest
his salary was determined by his rank and seniority
lose caste by doing work beneath one's station
he respected the dignity of the emissaries
he was born to the purple
they put him on a pedestal
they challenged his leadership of the union
