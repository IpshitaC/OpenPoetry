a lapse of three weeks between letters
after an ominous caesura the preacher continued
instant replay caused too long a delay
he ordered a hold in the action
they applied for an extension of the loan
meanwhile the socialists are running the government
he felt better after a little sleep
there wasn't time for a nap
roused him from his kip
people actually accomplish more when they take time for short rests
each team has two time-outs left
there was never a letup in the noise
a resting adult has a cardiac output of about three quarts a minute
the frequency of modulation was 40 cycles per second
the frequency of his seizures increased as he grew older
the engine was doing 6000 revs
some women do not control the spacing of their children
the meteorites struck the earth with hypervelocity impacts
a student's attendance is an important factor in her grade
they traveled at a rate of 55 miles per hour
