a cabbage patch
a briar patch
he bought a lot on the lake
from that vantage point he could survey the whole valley
at the peak of the pyramid
he looked the other direction
didn't know the way home
the river takes a southern course
the northeastern trend of the coast
the shoreward tendency of the current
the trend of the stock market
I questioned him about his whereabouts on the night of the crime
it was a wilderness preserved for the hawks and mountaineers
he broke the tape in record time
they opened a repair yard on the edge of town
an attempt to secure a bridgehead behind enemy lines
the only foothold left for British troops in Europe was Gibraltar
the Germans were desperately trying to contain the Anzio beachhead
tensions exist on both sides of the demilitarized zone separating North Korea and South Korea
they built a factory on the outskirts of the city
