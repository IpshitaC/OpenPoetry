they have serious linguistic deficits
there was no shortness of money
can cause shortness of breath
in a hurry to lock the door
the insistence of their hunger
the press of business matters
it vanished into thin air
they swam in the nude
in the raw
in the altogether
in his birthday suit
a state of undress
in your shirtsleeves" means you are not wearing anything over your shirt
in hot weather they dined in their shirtsleeves
the conception of grace developed alongside the conception of sin
it was debated whether saving grace could be obtained outside the membership of the church
the Virgin lived in a state of grace
his sermons were full of fire and brimstone
this dessert is a dream
they performed with great polish
