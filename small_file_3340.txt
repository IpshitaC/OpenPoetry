add a desirable note of specificity to the discussion
the specificity of the symptoms of the disease
host specificity of a parasite
so absorbed by the movement that she lost all sense of individuality
that singularity distinguished him from all his companions
the pervasiveness of the odor of cabbage in tenement hallways
he was surprised by the prevalence of optimism about the future
the currency of ideas
the totality of war and its consequences
the all-embracing totality of the state
the simplicity of a crystal
he enjoyed the complexity of modern computers
the tapestry of European history
these puzzles are famous for their trickiness
he was famous for the regularity of his habits
his compulsive organization was not an endearing quality
we can't do it unless we establish some system around here
the water was a glassy smoothness
the weather system of the Pacific is determined by the uninterrupted smoothness of the ocean
he kept a record of price fluctuations
