he lived a long and happy life
I have known him all his life
he appointed himself emperor for life
the monarch's last days
in his final years
during the German occupation of Paris
reporters dug into the candidate's past
they divorced after the birth of the child
his election signaled the birth of a new age
he was taught from the cradle never to cry
a perinatologist cared for her during the puerperium
lactation normally continues until weaning
he placed the incipience of democratic faith at around 1850
it is designed to arrest monopolies in their incipiency
she stayed until his death
a struggle to the last
it was the death of all his plans
a dying of old hopes
he went to his grave without forgiving me
from cradle to grave
