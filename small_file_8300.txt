a blade of lint on his suit
there was a blanket of snow
the brain was protected from the large molecules of the virus by the blood-brain barrier
he shot an arrow into the blue
heavenly body
they invaded our territorial waters
they were sitting by the water's edge
the creek dried up every summer
renal calculi can be very painful
Nelson defeated the French and Spanish fleets off Cape Trafalgar in 1805
a carpet of flowers
the larvae of some moths spin a web that resembles a carpet
he shared his catch with the others
his eyes were dark caverns
the ship went aground in the channel
he stood on a high cliff overlooking the town
a steep drop
when it snowed they made a coast on the golf course
he dropped the consolidation into the acid bath
there are seven continents
