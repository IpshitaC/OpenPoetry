kill the rat
throw the bum out
you cowardly little pukes!
the British call a contemptible person a `git'
swayer of the universe
he sent a runner over with the contract
he got theater tickets through a scalper

their quarterback was a good scrambler
scramblers can often unnerve a better tennis player
the cook is a light seasoner
he could learn at second hand from books
a team of aging second-raters
shone among the mediocrities who surrounded him
Edmund Randolph was the first Attorney General, appointed by President Washington
the first Secretary of Agriculture was Norman J. Colman, who was appointed by Cleveland
the first Commerce Secretary was William C. Redfield who was appointed by Wilson
