the collar has a tab with a button hole
the filing cards were organized by cards having indexed tabs
it was a sturdy table
I reserved a table at my favorite restaurant
a tablet of soap
a take-up that winds photographic film on a spool
he used a piece of tape for a belt
he wrapped a tape around the package
the several recordings were combined on a master tape
the carpenter should have used his tape measure
a teaser is used to disentangle the fibers
the telecom hotels are prime targets for bombing
I talked to him on the telephone
the British call a tv set a telly
he pitched his tent near the creek
the house was full
a thermobaric bomb can create overpressures equal to an atomic bomb
how does this thing work?
I couldn't tell what the thing was
he was cut down on a close play at third
