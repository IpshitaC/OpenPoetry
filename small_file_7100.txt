why this urge to travel?
he bought it on an impulse
he was tingling with pleasure
his delight to see her was obvious to all
he basked in the afterglow of his victory
second place was no consolation to him
he told me that time heals all wounds but that was cold comfort to me
every cloud has a silver lining
look on the bright side of it
as he heard the news he was suddenly flooded with relief
the pain of loneliness
pangs of regret
she felt a stab of excitement
twinges of conscience
an agony of doubt
the torments of the damned
death throes
the death of his wife caused him great distress
he feared that mentioning it might reopen the wound
deep in her breast lives the silent wound
