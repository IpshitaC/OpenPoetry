a drop of 57 points on the Dow Jones index
there was a drop in pressure in the pulmonary artery
a dip in prices
when that became known the price of their stock went into free fall
the store's dollar volume continues to rise
he questioned the sufficiency of human intelligence
the ampleness of her servings more than satisfied his hunger
the inadequacy of unemployment benefits
an exiguity of cloth that would only allow of miniature capes"-George Eliot
the haziness and wateriness of his disquisitions
the wateriness of his blood
no one enjoys the burning of his soup or the wateriness of his potatoes
new blood vessels bud out from the already dilated vascular bed to make up the nutritional deficit
an age of abundance
there was plenty of food for everyone
the profusion of detail
the idiomatic richness of English
she has a wealth of talent
the duties of citizenship are lost sight of in the wilderness of interests of individuals and groups
a wilderness of masts in the harbor
