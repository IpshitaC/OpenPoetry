a strange personage appeared at the door
she is the personification of optimism
the embodiment of hope
the incarnation of evil
the very avatar of cunning
the capitalists' deification of capital
a suppliant for her favors
they are heavy petters
he is a pillar of the community
they went west as pioneers with only the possessions they could carry with them
our pitcher has a sore arm
he's no plaster saint
he was a major player in setting up the corporation
he is quite the crowd pleaser
in England they call a slowpoke a slowcoach
the poet laureate is expected to provide poems for great national occasions
she is the poet laureate of all lyricists
he is the poet laureate of Arkansas
he is the president's point man on economic issues
it was an accident, officer
