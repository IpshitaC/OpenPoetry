any rotating body has an angular momentum about its center of mass
angular momentum makes the world go round
fatigue sapped his strength
the smallness of her voice
his muscular firmness
he didn't have the guts to try it
the marathon tests a runner's endurance
that old Broadway play really has legs
he had drunk beyond his capacity
immunity to criticism
the toxin's potency
the strength of the drinks
he hit with all the force he could muster
it was destroyed by the strength of the gale
a government has not the vitality and forcefulness of a living man
bore the brunt of the attack
the car's momentum carried it off the road
he plays tennis with great energy
he's full of zip
his music is characterized by a happy athleticism
