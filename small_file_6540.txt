his incrimination was based on my testimony
the police laid the blame on the driver
he listened to an address on minor Roman poets
a witty impromptu must not sound premeditated
he attended a lecture on telecommunications
the patient recited a litany of complaints
a litany of failures
the nomination was brief and to the point
he loved the sound of his own oratory
he delivered an oration on the decline of family values
people came to see the candidates and hear the speechmaking
Pericles' funeral oration for Athenians killed in the Peloponnesian War is a famous example of epideictic oratory
the raving of maniacs
some gentle arm-twisting produced the desired result
no amount of arm-twisting will get me to agree
he used all his conversational weapons
the packaging of new ideas
his letter of recommendation gave her a terrific buildup
the author got all his friends to write blurbs for his book
he mailed the circular to all subscribers
