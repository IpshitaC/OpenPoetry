the senators used their muscle to get the party leader to resign
courts having jurisdiction in this district
used all the resources at his disposal
concern about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine
he was at the top of his form
the team was off form last night
the greater penetration of the new projectiles will result in greater injuries
he lost his voice
he worked to the limits of his capability
they built their castles with an eye to their defensibility
client complaints create a felt need for the defensibility of individual actions
the job is executable for two million dollars
this contract is not executable
among his gifts is his capacity for true altruism
limited runway capacity
a great capacity for growth
we faced an army of great strength
politicians have neglected our military posture
test pilots try to push the envelope
in spite of their weakness the group remains active
