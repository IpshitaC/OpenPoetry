I was going to tell him but I got cold feet
his worry over the prospect of being fired
it is not work but worry that kills
he wanted to die and end his troubles
care had aged him
they hushed it up out of fear of public reaction
that guy gave me the willies
with a sinking heart
a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach
the watch dog gave her a feeling of security
I have confidence in our team
confidence is always borrowed, never owned
he could hardly conceal his excitement when she agreed
they got a great bang out of it
what a boot!
he got a quick rush from injecting heroin
he does it for kicks
the intoxication of wealth and power
with his classmates he felt a sense of belonging
their closeness grew as the night wore on
