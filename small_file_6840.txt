it came to a stop at the bottom of the hill
the deviation from the mean
they regarded the atom bomb as a monstrosity
the break in the dam threatened the valley
the telephone is an annoying interruption
there was a break in the action when a player was hurt
the new industry's economic shakedown
the rise and fall of the tides
an elevation of the temperature in the afternoon
a raising of the land resulting from volcanic activity
the heaving of waves on a rough sea
the sound awakened them
he didn't want to make a fuss
they had labor trouble
a spot of bother
the ship made little headway against the gale
his mother-in-law's visits were a great trial for him
life is full of tribulations
a visitation of the plague
lightning produced an unusual union of the metals
