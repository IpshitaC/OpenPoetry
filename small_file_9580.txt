he applied to the state for support
he could no longer earn his own livelihood
the foundation provided support for the experiment
all the comforts of home
social security provided only a bare subsistence
he brought back a large store of Cuban cigars
the Red Cross created a blood bank for emergencies
they set up a food bank for the flood victims
everyone contributed to the pool
the children returned from the seashore with their shells and other treasures
the pirates hid their treasure on a small island in the West Indies
all our valuables were stolen
look at the ice on that dame!
do you take plastic?
he paid all his bills by check
issuing a bad check is a form of larceny
cashier's checks are as good as cash
we tried to collect the money he owed us
he changed his money into francs
there is a desperate shortage of hard cash
