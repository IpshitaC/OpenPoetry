he's a mere slip of a lad
he's no slouch when it comes to baseball
a purse snatcher
the poor sod couldn't even buy a drink
the soldiers stood at attention
their son became a famous judge
his boy is taller than he is
what sort of person is he?
he's a good sort
I would use newspapermen as a sounding board for such policies
the speaker at commencement
an utterer of useful maxims
native speakers of French
the leader of the majority party is the Speaker of the House of Representatives
the spectators applauded the performance
television viewers
sky watchers discovered a new star
the last of the big spenders
his title is Director of Communications but he is just a spin doctor
the meeting was attended by spokespersons for all the major organs of government
