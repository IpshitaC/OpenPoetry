contact with the pier scraped paint from the hull
a year constitutes a cycle of the seasons
the cardiac cycle can be shown on an electrocardiogram
it was not possible to complete the computation in a single pass
the events today were a repeat of yesterday's
a cycle of reprisal and retaliation
if we lose the election the whole legislative merry-go-round will have to start over
the return of spring
the motorboat's wake capsized the canoe
the swash of waves on the beach
the fluctuations of the sea
soliton waves can travel long distances with little loss of energy or structure
the explosion created a shock wave
a sonic boom follows an aircraft as a wake follows a ship
a tidal wave of nausea
the flood of letters hit him with the force of a tidal wave
a tidal wave of crime
a colossal tsunami destroyed the Minoan civilization in minutes
gave the wet cloth a wring
the turning of the wind
