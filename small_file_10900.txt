a life of luxury and ease
he had all the material comforts of this world
he was raised in the lap of luxury
he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth
she is the daughter of old money from Massachusetts
her father questioned the young suitor's sufficiency
their indigence appalled him
a general state of need exists among the homeless
they were reduced to mendicancy
they glutted the market in order to cause a shakeout of their competitors
personal hygiene
he put his desk in order
the machine is now in working order
out of kilter
in good kilter
in good trim
the files are in complete disorder
the house was a mess
she smoothed the mussiness of the bed
carbon monoxide combines with hemoglobin and displaces oxygen in the blood
