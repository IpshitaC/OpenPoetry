I turned the controls over to her
the general in command never left the control center
he checked the instrument panel
suddenly the board lit up like a Christmas tree
the circus used a tent as their cookhouse
the cooling was overhead fans
she made a copy of the designer dress
the clone was a copy of its ancestor
the bundle was tied with a cord
each core has three wires passing through it, providing the means to select and detect the contents of each bit
standing on the corner watching all the girls go by
a piano was in one corner of the room
the cosmography of Ptolemy
he won the prize for best costume
he wore his national costume
in spite of the heat he insisted on his woolen costume
a counter may be used to stiffen the material around the heel and to give support to the foot
the course had only nine holes
the course was less than a mile
a course of bricks
