he memorized all the important chess openings
you have four downs to gain ten yards
he was at bat when it happened
he got four hits in four at-bats
he played catch with his son in the backyard
a round of golf takes about 4 hours
he played baseball in high school
there was a baseball game on every empty lot
there was a desire for National League ball in the area
play ball!
the umpire called it a no ball
he was up two breaks in the second set
the company still believes the chip is a leapfrog in integration and will pay huge dividends
he insisted that we give him the last cut before every deal
the cutting of the cards soon became a ritual
he played only draw and stud
he did it on a bet
they went on a bust that lasted three days
it was all done in play
their frolic in the surf threatened to become ugly
