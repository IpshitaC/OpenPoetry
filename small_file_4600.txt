this proves beyond peradventure that he is innocent
the matter remained in suspense for several years
his fear of being alone verges on morbidity
he went about his work as if in a dream
the process of thinking
the cognitive operation of remembering
the process of denial
his attentiveness to her wishes
he spends without heed to the consequences
he tried to get her ear
he tried to catch her eye
he escaped the notice of the police
his hard work soon attracted the teacher's notice
don't pay him any mind
he made a mental note to send her flowers
the focus of activity shifted to molecular biology
he had no direction in his life
she is in a deep study
don't get him started on his hobbyhorse
wakefulness, watchfulness, and bellicosity make a good hunter
