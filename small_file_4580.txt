racism is a pestilence at the heart of the nation
according to him, I was the canker in their midst
the policy found little public support
his faith was all the support he needed
the team enjoyed the support of their fans
faith is his anchor
the keystone of campaign reform was the ban on soft money
he is the linchpin of this firm
the airlift provided a lifeline for Berlin
she offered me a lifeline in my time of grief
its allurement was its remoteness
send two dollars or the equivalent in stamps
that tie makes a good match with your jacket
his certainty reassured the others
his assurance in his superiority did not make him popular
after that failure he lost his confidence
she spoke with authority
he wrote the paper with considerable reliance on the work of other scientists
he put more trust in his own two legs than in the gun
his indecision was only momentary but the opportunity was lost
