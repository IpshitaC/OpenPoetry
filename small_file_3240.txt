the publicity of the court room

he retracted nothing that he had said about the inappropriateness of either a corporeal God or a God who is a person
his praise released from her loud protestations of her unworthiness

the true nature of jealousy
he feared the speedy decline of all manhood
an air of mystery
the house had a neglected air
an atmosphere of defeat pervaded the candidate's headquarters
the place had an aura of romance
it ended on a sour note
there was a note of gaiety in her manner
he detected a note of sarcasm
that place gave me bad vibrations
