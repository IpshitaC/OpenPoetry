a card shark
a great hunter and spiller of blood
his students followed him like sheep
why does she like all those shkotzim?
shopaholics can never resist a bargain
he is a crack shot
a poor shooter
a shoveler of coal
don't be a silly
Odysseus ordered his crew to plug their ears so they would not hear the Siren's fatal song
none of her sisters would betray her
the Sisters taught her to love God
my sister married a musician
she's a dramatic slammer of doors
someone slapped me on the back and I turned to see who the slapper was
my father was the designated spanker in our family
a slave to fashion
a slave to cocaine
his mother was his abject slave
the winner was a true sleeper--no one expected him to get it
