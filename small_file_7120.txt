The right reader of a good poem can tell the moment it strikes him that he has taken an immortal wound--that he will never get over it"--Robert Frost
I've always had a liking for reading
she developed a liking for gin
he had a fondness for whiskey
my own preference is for good literature
the Irish have a penchant for blarney
martinis are an acquired taste
he has a weakness for chocolate
her inclination is for classical music
he felt leanings toward frivolity
he had no stomach for a fight
his account had a poignant undertow of regret
although she fussed at them, she secretly viewed all her children with approval
my dislike of him was instinctive
his disinclination for modesty is well known
he was held in contempt
the despite in which outsiders were held is legendary
the cave gave me the creepy-crawlies
they took a scunner against the United States
he was overwhelmed with gratitude for their help
