a change for the better
chose the better of the two
take the bad with the good
for better or for worse
accused of cheating and lying and worse
the evil that men do lives after them
the fluctuating monetary value of gold and silver
he puts a high price on his services
he couldn't calculate the cost of the collection
the store is famous for the reasonableness of its prices
the modestness of the living standards here becomes obvious immediately
he praised the richness of the soil
weeds lovely in their rankness
the relative poorness of New England farmland
the function of an auger is to bore holes
ballet is beautiful but what use is it?
of no avail
there's no help for it
he put his knowledge to good use
patrons have their uses
