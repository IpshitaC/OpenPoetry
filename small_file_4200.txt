the voicelessness of those who live in situations of hopelessness
the stories were of a dullness to bring a buffalo to its knees
peeling potatoes is a drag
a book so serious that it sometimes subsided into ponderousness
his lectures tend to heaviness and repetition
he reminded Mao that the paper tiger had nuclear teeth
a royal family living in unpretentious domesticity
the stuff of heros
you don't have the stuff to be a United States Marine
he thought she was really hot stuff
I fail to see the humor in it
the film captured all the pathos of their situation
the general tone of articles appearing in the newspapers is that the government should withdraw
from the tone of her behavior I gathered that I had outstayed my welcome
she began to recover from her numb unresponsiveness after the accident
in an instant all the deadness and withdrawal were wiped away
a prominent vascularity
the dancer was praised for her uncanny extension
good extension comes from a combination of training and native ability
he disliked his neighbors' snootiness
