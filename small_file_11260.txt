he nearly blew us to kingdom come
death put a period to his endeavors
a change soon put a period to my tranquility
the golden summer of his life
she was now of school age
tall for his eld
old age is not for sissies
he's showing his years
age hasn't slowed him down at all
a beard white with eld
on the brink of geezerhood
two days later they left
they put on two performances every day
there are 30,000 passengers per day
three nights later he collapsed
what are our tasks for tomorrow?
Today is beautiful
did you see today's newspaper?
it was in yesterday's newspapers
whenever he arrives she leaves on the morrow
