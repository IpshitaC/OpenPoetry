a large-scale farming operation
a multinational operation
they paid taxes on every stage of the operation
they had to consolidate their operations
business is good today
show me where the business was today
even before noon there was a considerable patronage
at the end of the year the accounting department showed that it was a wash
I have given this tailor my custom for many years
they are outstanding in their field
without competition there would be no market
they were driven from the marketplace
his business is packaging for transport
their main business is home construction
workers in the building trades
the channel will be open to navigation as soon as the ice melts
no transactions are possible without him
he has always been honest is his dealings with me
news of current affairs
great affairs of state
