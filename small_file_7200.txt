togetherness is the new wonder ingredient in marriage
his cheerfulness made everyone feel better
the chef tasted the sauce with great satisfaction
he takes pride in his son's success
his complacency was absolutely disgusting
nothing lifted the heaviness of her heart after her loss
she was exhausted by her misery and grief
he tried to express his sorrow at her loss
he is recovering from a broken heart
a broken heart languishes here
he drank to drown his sorrows
he wrote a note expressing his regret
to his rue, the error cost him the game
survivor guilt was first noted in those who survived the Holocaust
he felt responsible for her lowness of spirits
bowed down by the weight of responsibility
he was never slow to express his dissatisfaction with the service he received
he was suffering from museum fatigue
after watching TV with her husband she had a bad case of football fatigue
the American public is experiencing scandal fatigue
