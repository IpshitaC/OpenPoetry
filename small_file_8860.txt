the head of the whole operation
tickets are $5 per head
he chased the young hellions out of his yard
the new hires need special training
the chieftain had a herald who announced his arrival with a trumpet
he's the high priest of contemporary jazz
the hired hand fixed the railing
a ranch hand
a hard hitter
a fine striker of the ball
blacksmiths are good hitters
the bond was marked `payable to bearer'
they held two hostages
he holds the trophy
she holds a United States passport
their star pitcher was a holdout for six weeks
a homeless was found murdered in Central Park
he made an honest woman of her
the honker was fined for disturbing the peace
he was their best hope for a victory
