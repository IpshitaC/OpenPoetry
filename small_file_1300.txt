I'll see your raise and double it
I decided his double was a bluff
the control of the mob by the police was admirable
fiscal regulations are in the hands of politicians
the synchronization of their watches was an important preliminary
taxpayers want a hold-down on government spending
a freeze on hiring
he signed up for a week's car hire
they took possession of the ball on their own goal line
I resented his withholding permission
there were allegations of the withholding of evidence
I have some filing to do
he released his clasp on my arm
he has a strong grip for an old man
she kept a firm hold on the railing
a new council was installed under the direction of the king
he took aim and fired
the witnesses demanded police protection
he left his car in my keeping
my fate is in your hands
