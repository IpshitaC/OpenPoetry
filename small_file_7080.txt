she has a thing about him
the glow of new love
a glow of regret
the wildness of his anger
he spoke with great ardor
frightened by the storminess of their argument
he had an absolute zeal for litigation
he was immobilized by conflict and indecision
his ambition is to own his own business
he felt the temptation and his will power weakened
an appetite for life
the object of life is to satisfy as many appetencies as possible"- Granville Hicks
exercise gave him a good stomach for dinner
he got his wish
he was above all wishing and desire
he wanted a better sex life
the film contained no sex or violence
their love left them indifferent to their surroundings
she was his first love
common male fetishes are breasts, legs, hair, shoes, and underwear
