a tad too expensive
not a tad of difference
the new model is a shade better than the old one
the battalion was a mere skeleton of its former self
the bare skeleton of a novel
10 dollars worth of gasoline
he ate a large bag of popcorn
a basinful of water
he gave her a box of chocolates
he drank a cup of coffee
he borrowed a cup of sugar
they served me a dish of rice
he has a headful of baseball statistics
they entertained a houseful of guests
he drank a jar of beer
he bought a shelfful of books
he emptied out a shoeful of water
someone had to drive me home last night because I had a skinful
he added two spoons of sugar
a tub of water
