a rough idea how long it would take
he is always in the know
beyond my ken
he has virtually no understanding of social cause and effect
how you can do that is beyond my comprehension
he was famous for his comprehension of American literature
his incomprehension of the consequences
he has a good grasp of accounting practices
the lecture was beyond his most strenuous graspings
a keen musical sense
a good sense of timing
hindsight is always better than foresight
a growing realization of the risk involved
a sudden recognition of the problem he faced
increasing recognition that diabetes frequently coexists with other chronic diseases
he finally saw the light
can you shed light on this problem?
he had a flash of intuition
he didn't have the language to express his feelings
his main reading was detective stories
