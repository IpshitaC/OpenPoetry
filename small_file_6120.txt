tears are an expression of grief
the pulse is a reflection of the heart's condition
the Roman eagle
they checked everyone's badge before letting them in
place the mantle of authority on younger shoulders
the colonies revolted against the Crown
members of the British Commonwealth owe allegiance to the British Crown
a system for positive identification can prevent the use of a single identity by several people

that tax bill had the senator's fingerprints all over it
he was surprised to discover that green cards are no longer green

he was a familiar sight on the television
they went to Paris to see the sights
the tragic spectacle of cripples trying to escape
they put on the ritz
