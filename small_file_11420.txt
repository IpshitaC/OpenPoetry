the end of the year
the ending of warranty period
in the deep of night
in the deep of winter
the stopping point of each round was signaled by a bell
the market was up at the finish
they were playing better at the close of the season
it was the dawn of the Roman Empire
it was the evening of the Roman Empire
the fag end of this crisis-ridden century
the tail of the storm
the last gasp of the cold war
the expiry of his driver's license
on the threshold of manhood
the TV program has a new time slot
an aircraft landing slot
take time to smell the roses
I didn't have time to finish
it took more than half my time
he visited during my absence
