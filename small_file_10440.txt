at liberty to choose whatever occupation one wishes
the new freedom in movies and novels
allowed his children considerable latitude in how they spent their money
when liberty becomes license dictatorship is near"- Will Durant
the intolerable license with which the newspapers break...the rules of decorum"- Edmund Burke
he has the run of the house

So every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity"--Shakespeare
he was in bondage to fear:
he sought release from his bondage to Satan
a self freed from the bondage of time
penal servitude
the encapsulation of tendons in membranous sheaths
he was held in confinement
dogs should be kept under restraint
he was held in captivity until he died
the imprisonment of captured soldiers
his ignominious incarceration in the local jail
