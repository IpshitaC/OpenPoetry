the patient is on life support
the astronauts relied on their life-support systems
he stopped the car and turned off the lights

the limb of the sextant
the upper limb of the bow
a limiter introduces amplitude distortion
a washing line
a nice line of shoes
the walls are held together with metal links placed in the wet mortar during construction
he found quarters for his family
I visited his bachelor quarters
the local seemed to take forever to get to New York
they shot the film on location in Nevada
a lotion for dry skin
he put his golf bag in the trunk
tripped over a pile of magazines
there is no magic bullet against cancer
he took along a dozen tapes to record the interview
in Britain they call a mailbag a postbag
