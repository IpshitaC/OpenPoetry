She felt strong concern for those less fortunate
his major care was the illness of his wife
emotional distance
he has no conscience about his cruelty
he was filled with humility at the sight of the Pope
he looked at me in astonishment
her departure left him in utter devastation
he stared over the edge with a feeling of awe
his mother's death left him in a daze
he was numb with shock
the play kept the audience in suspense
in a fever of resentment
it revived their hope of winning the pennant
cruelty offended his sensibility
the remark hurt his feelings
he's got the fidgets
waiting gave him a feeling of restlessness
his stewing over the fight kept him awake most of the night
the stage crackled with electricity whenever she was on it
anticipation produced in me a sensation somewhere between hope and fear
