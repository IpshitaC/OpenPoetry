they kept a firm grip on the two top priorities
he was in the grip of a powerful emotion
a terrible power had her in its grasp
caught in the tentacles of organized crime
the public brought pressure to bear on the government
confessed under duress
New York is the commercial heartbeat of America
water is the lifeblood of India
the wheels of government began to turn
she knew many repellents to his advances
under control
he has the authority to issue warrants
deputies are given authorization to make arrests
a place of potency in the state
individualism is in danger of being swamped by a kind of corporatism
he has a hold over them
she rules the office with an iron fist
it takes an iron fist to contain the dissenting factions
he took up the reins of government
an admiral in command
