pioneers had to cross the continent on foot
he knocked off the corners
under a covering of dust
the fox was flushed from its cover
a curtain of secrecy
a curtain of trees
I could see the dandruff on her shoulders
Vienna, Budapest, and Belgrade are on the banks of the Danube
denizens of the deep
the Mississippi River delta
the Nile delta
the desiderata for a vacation are time and money
it was a good drive but the ball ended up in a divot
he jumped into the drink and had to be rescued
the Earth moves around the sun
he sailed around the world
the spacecraft detected an envelope of gas around the comet
they built it right over a geological fault
he studied the faulting of the earth's crust
the findings in the gastrointestinal tract indicate that he died several hours after dinner
