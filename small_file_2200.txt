the royal box was empty
an armed guard sat in the box with the driver
the umpire warned the batter to stay in the batter's box
he wore a brace on his knee
she wan not ready to put the brakes on her life with a marriage
new legislation will put the brakes on spending
pack the breakables separately
the breakfast nook had a built in table and seats
it was stored in a tube with a break seal
the ship was broadside to the dock
since buggies have been replaced by cars the buggy whip has become a symbol for anything that is hopelessly outmoded
there was a three-story building on the corner
it was an imposing edifice
the bulb of a syringe
we quaffed a bumper of ale
the ship's bunkers were full of coal
the Taliban forced all women to wear the burqa
a diesel engine is an oil burner
the electric range had one large burner and three smaller one
he always rode the bus to work
