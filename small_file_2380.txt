she used an eye dropper to administer medication to the eyes
duct tape holds the world together
an ammunition dump
he made a duplicate for the files
he built a modest dwelling near the pond
they raise money to provide homes for the homeless
it was not the typing but the earphones that she disliked
he rounded the edges of the box
the edge of the leaf is wavy
she sat on the edge of the bed
the water's edge
the coin bears an effigy of Lincoln
the emperor's tomb had his image carved in stone
his coat had patches over the elbows
the murderer was sentenced to die in the chair
return all empties to the store
medieval engines of war
the engine had to be replaced because the block was cracked
they waited at the entrance to the garden
beggars waited just outside the entryway to the cathedral
