he didn't get no invite to the party
an entreaty to stop the fighting
an appeal for help
an appeal to the public to keep calm
a solicitation to the king for relief
he watched the beggar trying to make a touch
his importunity left me no alternative but to agree
its was a brief and intense courtship
their youngest son said grace
many calls for Christmas stories
not many calls for buggywhips
the recall of our ambassador
they submitted their charges at the end of each month
his demands for attention were unceasing
linguistic purisms
after two raises there was a call
his challenge of the assumption that Japan is still our enemy
there was a question about my training
we made inquiries of all those who were present
my interviews with teenagers revealed a weakening of religious bonds
