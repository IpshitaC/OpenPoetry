a bevy of young beach boys swarmed around him
the firing line is where the action is
the seance was held in the medium's parlor
he cashed a check at the bank
that bank holds the mortgage on my home
terrorists make extensive use of hawala
before they publish any book they try to determine the size of the market for it
a defensive formation
a formation of planes
we were part of a caravan of almost a thousand camels
they joined the wagon train for safety
the march went up Fifth Avenue
the line stretched clear around the corner
you must wait in a long line at the checkout counter
the line of soldiers advanced with their bayonets fixed
they were arrayed in line of battle
the cast stood in line for the curtain call
a row of chairs
the pliers had serrations to improve the grip
