he arrived at work early today
they searched the wreckage for signs of survivors
it was a small house with almost no yard
a bug zapper
a great observer of human nature
the thing I like about her is ...
their different reactions reflected their very different personalities
it is his nature to help others
you can lose your identity when you join the army
finding her own personhood as a campus activist
education has for its object the formation of character"- Herbert Spencer
hearty showmanship and all-round outwardness
Socrates' inwardness, integrity, and inquisitiveness"- H.R.Finch
he disliked the worldliness of many bishops around him
it is his nature to help others
he has a happy disposition
he had a change of heart
that movie was pure corn
a person of hot blood
after an hour of waiting I was at the boiling point
