the ball at the base of the thumb
he stood on the balls of his feet
the funny bone is not humerus
skin from his thigh replaced the burned skin on his arms
the fall broke his back
the head of the humerus
the articulation of the radius and ulna in the arm is a pivot joint
he has a cold in the nose
her glasses left marks on the bridge of her nose
His dimple appeared whenever he smiled
he washed his face
I wish I had seen the look on his face when he got the news
an expression of pleasure crossed his features
his lineaments were very regular
the veins in his temple throbbed
Meckel's diverticulum is the rudiment of the embryonic yolk sac
stomach walls
the humors are blood and phlegm and yellow and black bile
chromosomes are distributed by spindles in mitosis and meiosis
rugae of the stomach
