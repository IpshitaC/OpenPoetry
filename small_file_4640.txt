he fell asleep to the music of the wind chimes
he thought he heard piano music next door
they tested his hearing with pure tones of different frequencies
modern music is just noise to me
he relied on somesthesia to warn him of pressure changes
he had a queasy feeling
I had a strange feeling in my leg
he lost all feeling in his arm
he felt a constriction in her chest
she felt an alarming tightness in her chest
emotion caused a constriction of his throat
she likes the touch of silk on her skin
the surface had a greasy feeling
the sensitivity of his skin to pressure and temperature was normal
as the intensity increased the sensation changed from tickle to pain
he shivered from the cold
the cold helped clear his head
seeing is believing
his lectures have no structure
he changed the arrangement of the topics
