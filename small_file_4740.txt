the pursuit of love
life is more than the pursuance of fame
a quest for wealth
thinking always made him frown
she paused for thought
I can't follow your line of reasoning
I couldn't follow his train of thought
he lost the thread of his argument
his resignation had political implications
jump to a conclusion
the diagonalization of a normal matrix by a unitary transformation
after much cogitation he rejected the offer
a little deliberation would have deterred them
he called for a careful exploration of the consequences
the habit of meditation is the basis for all real knowledge
I need to give it a good think
the sensitiveness of James's characters, their seeming inwardness
inwardness is what an Englishman quite simply has, painlessly, as a birthright
what is the origin of the outwardness of our sensations of sound, smell, or taste
an abstract conception with feelings of reality and spatial outwardness attached to it
