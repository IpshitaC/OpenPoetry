the engaged couple
an inseparable twosome
the whole room was cheering
a large turnout for the meeting
he joined a barbershop quartet
the foursome teed off before 9 a.m.
a married couple from Chicago
his second marriage was happier than the first
a married couple without love
the legal status of same-sex marriages has been hotly debated
the families of both partners in a mixed marriage often disapprove
we were visited at breakfast by a bevy of excited ducks
the fauna of China
the zoology of the Pliocene epoch
chemicals could kill all the wildlife
a school of small glittering fish swam by
a swarm of insects obscured the light
clouds of blossoms
it discharged a cloud of spores
a plague of grasshoppers
