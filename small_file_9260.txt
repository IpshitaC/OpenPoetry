an utterer of foul oaths
is the giraffe a vocalizer?
will you be my valentine?
Jeeves was Bertie Wooster's man
the veterans laughed at the new recruits
I thought we were partners, not victim and victimizer
he wanted to hear trained voices sing it
the cultured votary of science
a votary of Aphrodite
monasteries of votaries
young vowers of eternal love
there are many vowers of chastity but few who observe it
fat waddlers who walk like pigeons
Osama bin Laden is said to be a Wahhabi Muslim
street children beg or steal in order to survive
an early waker
the emergency room was overrun with walk-ins
a kitchen wallah
the book wallah
an owner of many things and needer of none
