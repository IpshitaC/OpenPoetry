an electric fire with three bars
I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole
they stormed the barricade
he drowned his sorrows in whiskey at the bar
the base of the lamp
he scrambled to get back to the bag
the attack wiped out our forward bases
a tub should sit on its own base
glycerinated gelatin is used as a base for many ointments
he told the painter that he wanted a yellow base with just a hint of green
everything she cooked seemed to have rice as the base
the church was raised to the rank of basilica
she mixed the dough in a large basin
the architecture was a kind of bastard suggesting Gothic but not true Gothic
she soaked the etching in an acid bath
he opened the bomb bay
they put him in the sick bay
they sighted land on the port beam
he sat on the edge of the bed
the room had only a bed and chair
