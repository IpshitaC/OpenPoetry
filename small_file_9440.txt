a head of lettuce
black walnut kernels are difficult to get out of the shell
stems bearing slender wands of flowers
they shared a community of possessions
stock options are not much use as an incentive if the price at which they can be exercised is out of reach
that hat is my property
he is a man of property
he left all his worldly possessions to his daughter
she left some of her personal effects in the house
I watched over their effects until they returned
she packed her things and left
the family owned a large estate on Long Island
she picked up a hire car at the airport and drove to her hotel
he built the house on land leased from the city
all his money is in real estate
she made a bundle selling real estate
they sank megabucks into their new house
did you take all your clobber?
a recent acquisition by the museum
the librarian shelved the new accessions
