the doctor gave him a clean bill of health
an assurance of help when needed
signed a pledge never to reveal the secret
they took vows of poverty
he expressed his appreciation in a short note
his brag is worse than his fight
whenever he won we were exposed to his gasconade
the part he failed was the naming of state capitals
he could never refuse a dare
threw down the gauntlet
took up the gauntlet
I heard his explanation of the accident
he suffered the imprecations of the mob
his wife gave a recital of his infidelities
the program included songs and recitations of well-loved poems
an allegation of malpractice
he denied the imputation
they want all the finger-pointing about intelligence failures to stop
the book is an indictment of modern philosophy
preferment of charges
