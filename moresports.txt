he was called for setting an illegal pick
it took two strokes to get out of the bunker
a good shot requires good balance and tempo
he left me an almost impossible shot
cuts do not bother a good tennis player
he won the point on a cross-court return
his powerful serves won the game
he served too many double faults
he took a vicious cut at the ball
he took lessons to cure his slicing
he took lessons to cure his hooking
he sliced his drive out of bounds
his putting let him down today
he lost the hole when his approach rolled over the green
marketing this product will be no picnic
she checked several points needing further work
the action is no longer in technology stocks but in municipal bonds
gawkers always try to get as close to the action as possible
dry rot did the job of destroying the barn
the barber did a real job on my hair
