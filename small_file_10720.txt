he enjoyed being in the limelight
when Congress investigates it brings the full glare of publicity to the agency
that candidate does not have sufficient visibility to win an election
he was never one to keep a low profile
a person of importance
the red light gave the central figure increased emphasis
the room was decorated in shades of grey with distinctive red accents
the stress was more on accuracy than on speed
a scholar of great eminence
the lion is the king of beasts
he wanted to achieve power and prestige
he worked in obscurity for many years
he came out of nowhere
he valued glory above life itself
it is held in esteem
a man who has earned high regard
a man of great stature
his behavior gave the whole family a black eye
his stock was so high he could have been elected mayor
he is a man of character
