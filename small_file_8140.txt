an ethnic neighborhood
she blushed in his presence
he sensed the presence of danger
he was well behaved in front of company
he was waiting for them at the rendezvous
He ran to safety
He moved out of danger
his poetry celebrated the slower pace of life in the country
he withdrew to his sanctum sanctorum, where the children could never go
the police returned to the scene of the crime
he stepped into the light
he moved off into the darkness
All the world's a stage"--Shakespeare
it set the stage for peaceful negotiations
he hid in the separation between walls
he booked their seats in advance
he sat in someone else's place
no section of the nation is more ardent than the South
there are three synagogues in the Jewish section
the hypotenuse of a right triangle is always the longest side
