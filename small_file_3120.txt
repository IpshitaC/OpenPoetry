I despair at the flightiness and whimsicality of my memory
her pleasant personality is already a recommendation
his wealth was not a passport into the exclusive circles of society
I don't like the looks of this place

I wanted to create an impression of success
she retained that bold effect in her reproductions of the original painting
he cut a fine figure
a heroic figure
although her popular image was contrived it served to inspire music and pageantry
the company tried to project an altruistic image
it was in London that he made his mark
he left an indelible mark on the American theater
the full phase of the moon
the audience was held by the substance of the play rather than by the superficies of the production"-R.W.Speaight
the delicate cast of his features
a public image is as fragile as Humpty Dumpty
he hoped his claims would have a semblance of authenticity
he tried to give his falsehood the gloss of moral sanction
