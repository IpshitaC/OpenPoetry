he writes stories for the magazines
the parable of the prodigal son
the characters were well drawn but the plot was banal
his novels always have a lot of action
the deathbed scene is the climax of the play
`The president is George W. Bush, Who is happy to sit on his tush, While sending his armies to fight, For anything he thinks is right' is a clerihew
he had heard some silly doggerel that kept running through his mind
the Spenserian stanza was introduced by Edmund Spenser in The Faerie Queene
he signed and mailed his dictation without bothering to read it
there were more than a thousand words of text
they handed out the printed text of the mayor's speech
he wants to reconstruct the original text
pictures made the text easier to understand
another word had been written over the erasure
he jotted a note in the margin
write your name in the space provided
a preliminary draft
the final draft of the constitution
he sent them soft copy of the report
he ran off a hard copy of the report
