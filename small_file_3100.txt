the virulence of the malicious old man
he enjoyed the flexibility of his working arrangement
the request left some wiggle room for future restructuring
he was valued for his reliability and pliability
he increased the leanness and suppleness of the organization
he was a man of judicial deliberation
it was a policy of desperation
I admired the carefulness of his work
a man of caution
he keeps a weather eye open for trouble
he inherited his delinquency from his father
his derelictions were not really intended as crimes
his adolescent protest consisted of willful neglect of all his responsibilities
the students associated science with masculinity and arts with effeminacy
Spartans accused Athenians of effeminateness
he was shocked by the softness of the atmosphere surrounding the young prince, arising from the superfluity of the femininity that guided him
he holds a position of great responsibility
it was John's fault
the solidity of the evidence worked in his favor
the solidness of her faith gave her enduring hope
