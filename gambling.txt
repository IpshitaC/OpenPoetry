he ignored their teases
his ribbing was gentle but persistent
scuba diving is provided as a diversion for tourists
for recreation he wrote poetry and solved crossword puzzles
drug abuse is often regarded as a form of recreation
romantic novels were her escape from the stress of daily life
his alcohol problem was a form of escapism
I do it for the fun of it
he is fun to have around
his gambling cost him a fortune
there was heavy play at the blackjack table
they played word games
he thought of his painting as a game that filled his empty time
his life was all fun and games
a futile search for intelligent nightlife
in the summer the nightlife shifts to the dance clubs
sailing is her favorite pastime
his main pastime is gambling
he counts reading among his interests
