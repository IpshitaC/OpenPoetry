the cut from the accident scene to the hospital seemed too abrupt
they wanted to see some of the shows on Broadway
did you see his program last night?
we watch the 7 o'clock news every night
she likes to watch `I love Lucy' reruns
in England they call a talk show a chat show
a comedy series
the Masterworks concert series
mailed an indignant letter to the editor
drop me a line when you get there
he had to get his mother to write an excuse for him
they sent us a card from Miami
she must have seen him but she gave no sign of acknowledgment
the preface contained an acknowledgment of those who had helped her
they said their good-byes
much hand-shaking and well-wishing
give him my kind regards
my best wishes
she did not expect the cold reception she received from her superiors
the proposal got a warm welcome
