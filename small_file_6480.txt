a shower of protest was heard from the rear of the hall
a jeremiad against any form of government
grammatical mistakes are his pet peeve
their pitiful laments could be heard throughout the ward
we received a notice to vacate the premises
he gave notice two months before he moved
they gave little warning of their arrival
she had only had four days' warning before leaving Berlin
a display of emotion
she tends to make a big production out of nothing
they feared exposure of their campaign plans
he published an expose of the graft and corruption in city government
they won all the concessions they asked for
the offer was a sop to my feelings
a stipulation of fact was made in order to avoid delay
he heard reports that they were causing trouble
by all accounts they were a happy couple
he insisted on giving us the whole megillah
this accords with the recent study by Hill and Dale
he wanted the inside skinny on the new partner
