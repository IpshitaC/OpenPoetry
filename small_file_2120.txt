he banked the shot off the backboard
the backbone is the part of a communication network that carries the heaviest traffic
he made a backup in case the original was accidentally damaged or erased
he stuffed his laundry into a large bag
he carried his small bag onto the plane with him
she reached into her bag and found a comb
the ball travelled 90 mph on his serve
the mayor threw out the first ball
the ball rolled into the corner pocket
he played with his rubber ball in the bathtub

he bought a hot dog and a coke at the bar
spectators were not allowed past the bar
