the groundlessness of their report was quickly recognized
his promise is not worth a damn
not worth one red cent
not worth shucks
he rejected the vanities of the world
the child was as good as gold
she has a heart of gold
her price is far above rubies
weigh the good against the bad
among the highest goods of all are happiness and self-realization
for the benefit of all
it turned out to my advantage
reaping the rewards of generosity
for your sake
died for the sake of his country
in the interest of safety
in the common interest
in your behalf
campaigning in his own behalf
spoke a good word in his friend's behalf
