the country--the flat agricultural surround
a crowd assembled at the finish
he was nearly exhausted as their destination came into view
fish require an aqueous medium
the perfect setting for a ghost story
the scenario is France during the Reign of Terror
water is the element of fishes
the equator is the boundary between the northern and southern hemispheres
anthropologists do much of their work in the field
he planted a field of wheat
the home crowd cheered when Princeton took the field
he was in the forefront
he was at the head of the column
the Warsaw ghetto
the ball rolled across the green and into the bunker
they gained ground step by step
they fought to regain the lost ground
a marine habitat
he felt safe on his home grounds
the park authorities operated a trout hatchery
