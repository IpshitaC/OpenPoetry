he didn't like the crowding on the beach
an end-of-the year crunch
a financial crunch

the police are now back at square one after having arrested and released 27 men
she has tried to diet but always ends up back at square one
he was trapped in a medical swamp
standardization of nuts and bolts had saved industry millions of dollars
