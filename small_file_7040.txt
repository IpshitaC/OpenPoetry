he gave a speech as part of his installation into the hall of fame
a bar mitzvah is an important social event
academic exercises
a mere formality
their rancor dated from a political dogfight between them
a real dogfight for third place
a prolonged dogfight over their rival bids for the contract
the race is to the swift
she broke the record for the half-mile run
the visiting team swept the series

the Epsom race meeting was an important social event
he is preparing for the 100-yard dash
he holds the record in the mile
a takedown counts two points
the race for the presidency

he is raising money for a Senate run
a narrow victory
the general always gets credit for his army's victory
