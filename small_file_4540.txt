the crash intruded on his awareness
days of danger and nights of waking
consciousness during wakefulness in a sane person is pretty well ordered and familiar
she went about her chores on automatic pilot
too much of the writing seems to have been done on automatic pilot
she talked and he dozed and my mind went on autopilot
his grogginess was caused as much by exhaustion as by the blows
someone stole his wallet while he was in a drunken stupor
deep-sea divers can suffer nitrogen narcosis from breathing air under high pressure
an interest in music
a confusion of impressions
his disorientation was the result of inattention
he drives me to distraction
how it got out is a mystery
it remains one of nature's secrets
a tangle of government regulations
they believe that the books of Scripture were written under divine guidance
serious difficulties were encountered in obtaining a pure reagent
one trouble after another delayed the job
what's the problem?
