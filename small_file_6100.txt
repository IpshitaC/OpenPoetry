the book was published under a distinguished imprint
the warrant bore the sheriff's seal
he entered to a flourish of trumpets
her arrival was greeted with a rousing fanfare
the violinist was indulgent with his swoops and slides
a simple harmony written in major thirds
the spaces are the notes F-A-C-E
the orchestra omitted the last twelve bars of the song
the singer held the note too long
they saw the light of the beacon
there was a light at every corner
she made a grimace at the prospect
his face wrinkled in a silent laugh of derision
the lecture was accompanied by dramatic demonstrations
the lecturer shot off a pistol as a demonstration of the startle response
made a display of strength
a show of impatience
a good show of looking interested
it was a mere glance, but the eye contact was enough to tell her that he was desperate to leave
speak softly but carry a big stick
