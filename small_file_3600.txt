a lonely way of life
in an abrasive fashion
an imaginative orchestral idiom
his treatment of space borrows from Italian architecture
she adjusted the drape of her skirt
I admired the fit of her coat
his resentment took the form of extreme hostility
life in fashion's fast lane has taught her a lot
it takes time to learn the setup around here
this room needs a woman's touch
in no wise
in this wise
he adjusted the hang of his coat
artists must study the structure of the human body
the structure of the benzene molecule
the architecture of a computer's system software
providing a factual framework for future research
it is part of the fabric of society
breadfruit has the same texture as bread
sand of a fine grain
