clinched a victory
convincing victory
the agreement was a triumph for common sense
they maintained close relations with England even after independence
Roosevelt defeated Hoover in a landslide
we had the last laugh after the votes were counted
it was a narrow defeat
the army's only defeat
they suffered a convincing licking
he met his waterloo
the trials for the semifinals began yesterday
after fishing for an hour he still had not had a bite
the demand for testing has created a boom for those unregulated laboratories where boxes of specimen jars are processed like an assembly line
women have been blamed ever since the Fall
that was the shipwreck of their romance
the crash occurred during a thunderstorm and the system has been down ever since
the seismograph showed a sharp spike in response to the temblor
they gave it another zap of radiation
a nasty zizz in the engine
he has a thing about seafood
