fishing was their main sustainment
wondered who had made the booking
a small token in admiration of your works
the glorification of God
the idealization of rural life was very misleading
used the carrot of subsidized housing for the workers to get their vote
he published an unexpected attack on my work
let it be no detraction from his merits to say he is plainspoken
his foolishness was followed by an exacerbation of their quarrel
there was an easiness between them
a natural easiness of manner
they made a mock of him
turning his back on me was a deliberate insult
his presumption was intolerable
the snub was clearly intentional
the ordinary reader is endowed with considerable wisdom and knowledge of the way of the world
she was well-versed in the ways of the world before she had taken the veil
he was amazingly innocent of the ways of the world
he did me a good turn
distributing food and clothing to the flood victims was an act of mercy
