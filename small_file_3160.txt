a fleck of red
a green toad with small black stripes or bars
may the Stars and Stripes forever wave
the glory of the sunrise
the liveliness and pleasingness of dark eyes"- T.N. Carver
the sultriness of her look was unmistakable
the sultriness of lust was in the air
his smile was part of his appeal to her
he succumbed to the siren call of the wilderness
he gets by largely on pure spiff
her personality held a strange attraction for him
an affinity for politics
the mysterious affinity between them
James's affinity with Sam
she was an invitation to trouble
he held the children spellbound with magic tricks and other fascinations
she has a show-stopper of a smile
the brilliant orange flowers against the green foliage were a showstopper
there were distinguishing disfigurements on the suspect's back
suffering from facial disfiguration
