in spite of our warnings he plowed ahead with the involuntariness of an automaton
a reluctance to commit himself
his hesitancy revealed his basic indisposition
after some hesitation he agreed
a lack of solemnity is not necessarily a lack of seriousness"- Robert Rice
a man of energy and commitment
this job calls for the investment of some hard thinking
he made an emotional investment in the work
her mood changed and she was all lightness and joy
her playfulness surprised me
he was fun to be with
she didn't appreciate my humor
you can't survive in the army without a sense of humor
his silence about my contribution was surprising
mum's the word
mammals as a class are not strong on sociality
the queen's condescension was intended to make us feel comfortable
the absence of fences created a mysterious intimacy in which no one knew privacy
when he learned who I was he became all sweetness and light
he could not conceal his hostility
