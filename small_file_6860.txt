a gradual mixture of cultures
it suddenly spewed out a thick green concoction
the uplifting of the clouds revealed the blue of a summer sky
he heard the beat of a drum
saved by the bell
she heard the distant toll of church bells
the buzz of a bumble bee
a chorus of boos
he could hear the clang of distant bells
the shutters clattered against the house
the clatter of iron wheels on cobblestones
the clickety-clack of the typewriters
the crack of a whip
he heard the cracking of the ice
he can hear the snap of a twig
the creak of the floorboards gave him away
he heard the crunch of footsteps on the gravel path
animal cries filled the night
the constant sound of dripping irritated him
he could hear the drums before he heard the fifes
