a splatter of mud
just a splash of whiskey
a spot of tea
a bit of paper
a bit of lint
I gave him a bit of my mind
they escaped by a hair's-breadth
they lost the election by a whisker
England still expects a modicum of eccentricity in its artists"- Ian Jack
the first scatterings of green
a sprinkling of grey at his temples
he managed it on a shoestring
a spray of bullets
my horse lost the race by a nose
it's only a step to the drugstore
he accepted the little they gave him
give him a shtik cake
he's a shtik crazy
he played a shtik Beethoven
have a shtikl cake
