the track record for the mile and a half at Belmont is 2 minutes 24 seconds held by Secretariat since 1973
his success in the marathon was unexpected
his new play was a great success
winning is not everything
that movie was the sleeper of the summer
that song was his first hit and marked the beginning of his career
that new Broadway show is a real smasher
the party went with a bang
the new advertising campaign was a bell ringer
scored a bull's eye
hit the mark
the president's speech was a home run
the conquest of space
they passed inspection with flying colors
his future depended on his passing that test
he got a pass in introductory chemistry
he resented my failure to return his call
the mechanic's failure to check the brakes
his failure to pass the test
his failing the course led to his disqualification
