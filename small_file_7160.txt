he performed with all the coolness of a veteran
the easiness we feel when sleeping
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
his face turned red with rage
he took offence at my question
having one's hackles or dander up
his temper sparked like damp firewood
her constant complaints were the main source of his frustration
so great was his harassment that he wanted to destroy his tormentors
he gives me the creeps
a frisson of surprise shot through him
it threw her into a swivet
the fear of God
the Chinese reverence for the dead
the French treat food with gentle reverence
his respect for the law bordered on veneration
the student looked around the examination room with apprehension
a steadily escalating sense of foreboding
the lawyer had a presentiment that the judge would dismiss the case
a shadow over his happiness
