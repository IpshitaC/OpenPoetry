all that academic rigmarole was a waste of time
they fell into a conversational rut
the ceremony of smelling the cork and tasting the wine
he makes a ceremony of addressing his golf ball
he disposed of it without ceremony
an inaugural ceremony
the rite of baptism
there's no weeping at an Irish wake
since he lacks originality he must rely on quotation
the Sunday service
don't be late for church
he was late for chapel
the offices of the mass
the committal service will be held next Monday
the governor took Communion with the rest of the congregation
their marriage was conducted in the chapel
most churches baptize infants but some insist on adult baptism
the Cardinal attended the consecration of the church
his consecration to study
oblations for aid to the poor
