the addition of flowers created a pleasing effect
the addition of a leap day every four years
the court ordered a retrofit on all automobiles
the news caused a general advance on the stock market
an appreciation of 30% in the value of real estate
depreciation of the dollar against the yen
stimulated a surge of speculation
an upsurge of emotion
an upsurge in violent crime
the dilation of the pupil of the eye
tension holds the belt in the pulleys
higher wages caused an escalation of prices
there was a gradual escalation of hostilities
the dance involved a deliberate exaggeration of his awkwardness
extension of the program to all in need
the dispersion of the troops
the diffusion of knowledge
it is an obvious truncation of the verse
they were sentenced to a truncation of their limbs
running at full stretch
