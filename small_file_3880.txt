he took advantage of the lowness of interest rates
he carried it to extremes
a wolf is about the size of a large dog
he blanched when he saw the size of the bill
the only city of any size in that area
it is cheaper to buy it in bulk
he received a mass of correspondence
the volume of exports
he adjusted the intensity of the sound

she exercised to avoid that middle-aged spread
the tenuity of a hair
the thinness of a rope
he admired the ampleness of its proportions
in careful usage the noun enormity is not used to express the idea of great size
universities recognized the enormity of their task
the capaciousness of Santa's bag astounded the child
roominess in this size car is always a compromise
his new office lacked the spaciousness that he had become accustomed to
the might have repercussions of unimaginable largeness
