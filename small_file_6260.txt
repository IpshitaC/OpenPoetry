he uttered harsh language
he recorded the spoken language of the streets
I listened to his words very closely
they were perfectly comfortable together without speech
a singer takes good care of his voice
the giraffe cannot make any vocalizations
his stop consonants are too aspirated
the insertion of a vowel in the plural of the word `bush' is epenthesis
the `n' in `thinness' is a geminate
the speaker was interrupted by loud cries from the rear of the audience
a cry of rage
a yell of pain
his bellow filled the hallway
she screamed blue murder
he ignored the clamor of the crowd
he gave a great halloo but no one heard him
the announcement of the election recount caused a lot of noise
whatever it was he didn't like it and he was going to let them know by making as loud a noise as he could
her screaming attracted the neighbors
it was smoking-room bawdry
