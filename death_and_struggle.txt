his insistence was pure self-destruction
a bloodbath took place when the leaders of the plot surrendered
ten days after the bloodletting Hitler gave the action its name
the valley is no stranger to bloodshed and murder
a huge prison battue was ordered
when the shooting stopped there were three dead bodies
no evidence that the choking was done by the accused
getting through that small opening was a tight squeeze
a bad case of the heaves
strangulation of the intestine
the abolition of capital punishment
he quit smoking cold turkey
she quit her job cold turkey
they regretted the closure of the day care center
the extinction of the lights
any derogation of the common law is to be strictly construed
recission may be brought about by decree or by mutual consent
the vitiation of the contract
the neutralization of Belgium
there was a reversal of autonomic function
