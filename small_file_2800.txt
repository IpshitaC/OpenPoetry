as the sun moved he readjusted the shade
he bought a shag rug
a knife sharpener
the clock has a walnut case
he had spilled catsup on his shirtfront
in Britain they call a shirtwaist a shirtwaister
the old car needed a new set of shocks
he bought it at a shop on Cape Cod
the productive work is done on the shop floor
she loaded her shopping into the car"women carrying home shopping didn't give me a second glance
the shot buzzed past his ear
he trained at putting the shot
the car pulled off onto the shoulder
an ornamental gold braid on the shoulder of his uniform
they installed a shower in the bathroom
in Britain a showroom is called a salesroom
he turned the box over to examine the bottom side
they painted all four sides of the house
the car had white sidewalls
the highway was lined with signboards
