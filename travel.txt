if you've time to spare go by air
I took the noon flight to Chicago
how many nonstops are there to Dallas?
he took the redeye in order to get home the next morning
flying was still an exciting adventure for him
he had done a lot of parachuting in the army
the Stealth bomber made its maiden flight in 1989
the plane turned to make a second pass
then we embarked on the second stage of our Caribbean cruise
there is standing room only on the high-speed commute
he took the family for a drive in his new car
it's a long haul from New York to Los Angeles
he took a trip to the shopping center
the ship made its run in record time
take a run into town
the outward passage took 10 days
he gave me a lift home
they took their girlfriends for joyrides in stolen cars
he took the new car for a spin
they took an extended tour of Europe
