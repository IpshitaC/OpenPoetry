a lofty aspirant
two executive hopefuls joined the firm
the audience was full of Madonna wannabes
he is not an appreciator of our dilemma
the critic was considered to be an arbiter of modern literature
the arbitrator's authority derived from the consent of the disputants
an umpire was appointed to settle the tax case
she was the final arbiter on all matters of fashion
a sword made by a famous English armorer
he's a retired army officer
the hands of an elderly arthritic
his assassins were hunted down like animals
assassinators of kings and emperors
a bold asserter
a declarer of his intentions
affirmers of traditional doctrine
an asseverator of strong convictions
an avower of his own great intelligence
my invaluable assistant
they hired additional help to finish the work
