my greed was the instrument of my destruction
science has given us new tools to fight disease
the road to fame
the royal road to success
the job was just a stepping stone on his way to fame and riches
the situation called for strong measures
the police took steps to reduce crime

the acquisition gave the company a safe harbor
he acted as a backstop in case anything went wrong
a double-blind procedure is used to guard against both experimenter bias and placebo effects
he uses drugs as a psychological crutch
`pis aller' is French for `worst going'
he had to resort to desperate measures
tourism was their economic salvation
they turned to individualism as their salvation
the treaty had no teeth in it
the voice of the law
the Times is not the voice of New York
conservatism has many voices
