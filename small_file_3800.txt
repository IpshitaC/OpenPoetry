the project advanced with gratifying speed
he lived at a fast pace
he works at a great rate
the pace of events accelerated
the cox raised the beat
fleetness of foot
the immediacy of their response
the instancy of modern communication
it was done with dispatch
he soon regretted his haste
modern science caused an acceleration of cultural change
his car has a lot of pickup
he is responsible for the precipitation of his own demise
the deceleration of the arms race
the sluggishness of the economy
the sluggishness of the compass in the Arctic cold
all matter has dimensionality
the directionality of written English is from left to right
he could barely make out their shapes
the starfish illustrates radial symmetry
