it was stuff I had heard before
there's good stuff in that book
his father signed his report card
his narration was hesitant
his narrative was interesting
Disney's stories entertain adults as well as children
he was forced to listen to a recital of his many shortcomings
he was the hero according to his own relation
his endless recounting of the incident eventually became unbearable
the divorce caused much gossip
the news of their affair was spread by word of mouth
there has been talk about you lately
a warning that still more bombs could explode
the bombing was a wake-up call to strengthen domestic security
a caveat against unfair practices
he sent a heads-up to the District Attorney
they were under threat of arrest
they took an oath of allegiance
he gave his word
the President's assurances were not respected
