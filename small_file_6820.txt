he described a refinement of this technique
there was a ground swell of antiwar sentiment
a successful leap from college to the major leagues
this may not insure success but it will represent a quantum leap from last summer
their parting was a sad scene
instruction is not an educational sideshow
the roof is in danger of collapse
the collapse of the old star under its own gravity
a cessation of the thunder
it was a miracle that he survived the drop from that height
irrigation by gravitation rather than by pumps
before the set of sun
a little shower of rose petals
a sudden cascade of sparks
they still talk about the sinking of the Titanic
he could feel the shimmy in the steering wheel
the play was a dismal flop
the first experiment was a real turkey
the meeting was a dud as far as new business was concerned
the implosion of a light bulb
