his spirit rose
he is currently suffering financial embarrassments
listening to sweet music in a perfect rapture"- Charles Dickens
dull repetitious work gives no gratification
to my immense gratification he arrived on time
the new art museum is expected to improve the quality of life
his friendship was a comfort
a padded chair was one of the room's few comforts
he was in such a state you just couldn't reason with him
the embitterment that resulted from the loss of his job never left him
she tired of his perpetual sadness
a moment of extraordinary poignancy
the trial established his innocence
investigation showed that he was in the clear
many have doubts about giving him a free hand to attack
he gave free rein to his impulses
they gave full play to the artist's talent
liberty of opinion
liberty of worship
liberty--perfect liberty--to think or feel or do just as one pleases
