Rome had fallen into moral putrefaction
ambitious men are led astray by an infection that is almost unavoidable
attempts to explain the origin of evil in the world
the invaders did their worst
so pure of heart that his worst is another man's best
this deformity and filthiness of sin
there will always be a few people who, through macho perversity, gain satisfaction from bullying and terrorism
he feels that you are in the wrong
ancient Egyptians believed in the divinity of the Pharaohs
every politician fears to touch that holy of holies, the Social Security System
he kept fighting on pure spunk
you haven't got the heart for baseball
he showed great heroism in battle
he received a medal for valor
the proposal required great boldness
the plan required great hardiness of heart
faintness of heart and infirmity of purpose
his resoluteness carried him through the battle
it was his unshakeable resolution to finish the work
this kind of tension is not good for my nerves
