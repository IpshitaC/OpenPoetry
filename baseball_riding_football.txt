you only get 3 outs per inning
the shortstop got the runner at second on a force
the first baseman made 15 putouts
the batter hit a liner to the shortstop
he hit a double to deep centerfield
he gave me a clip on the ear
he gave the table a whack
the whip raised a red welt
I gave him a clout on his nose
I gave him a good box on the ear
she gave me a sharp dig in the ribs
he gave the ball a powerful kick
the team's kicking was excellent
the punt traveled 50 yards
punting is an important part of the game
there was a brief kiss of their hands in passing
peonies can be blighted by the laying on of a finger
Mays made the catch with his back to the plate
he made a grab for the ball before it landed
Martin's snatch at the bridle failed and the horse raced away
