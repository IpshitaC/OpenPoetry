as he waited he could feel the air on his neck
there wasn't a breath of air in the room
the battery needed a fresh charge
rain and high winds covered the region
the current was measured in amperes
the animal died a painful death
exfoliation is increased by sunburn
the cold glasses were streaked with sweat
it was the kind of duster not experienced in years
they built a car that runs on electricity
the DOE is responsible for maintaining the energy policy
energy can take a wide variety of forms
according to quantum theory only certain energy levels are possible
work equals force times distance
plains fertilized by annual inundations
we were lucky to be safe when the floodheads hit
the fine structure results from slightly different energy levels
force equals mass times acceleration
the more remote the body the less the gravity
the gravitation between two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
