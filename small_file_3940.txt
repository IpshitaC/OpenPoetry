the slenderness of the chances that anything would be done
the slenderness of the evidence

we were surprised by the extravagance of his description
four-year-olds have an overabundance of energy

the margin of victory
in engineering the margin of safety is the strength of the material minus the anticipated stress
the president was not humbled by his narrow margin of victory

he had a number of chores to do
the number of parameters is small
the figure was about a thousand
a preponderance of evidence against the defendant
the majority of his customers prefer it
the bulk of the work is finished
