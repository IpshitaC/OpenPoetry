the plane was given clearance to land
he gave me his conge
He objected to the allowance of smoking in the dining room
a zoning variance
preparations for the ceremony had begun
we are prepared today because of groundwork that was done ten years ago
the planning was more fun than the trip itself
the unlawful restraint of trade
asked for a collar on program trading in the stock market
kept a tight leash on his emotions
he's always gotten a long leash
rain put a damper on our picnic plans
his common sense is a bridle to his quick temper
the storm caused complete immobilization of the rescue team
the suspect is in custody
the containment of the AIDS epidemic
the containment of the rebellion
ring containment is a proven method of halting a smallpox epidemic
a suppression of the newspaper
the restriction of the infection to a focal area
