they loved to roam the hills of West Virginia
he built himself a cabin in a hollow high up in the Appalachians
a hunk of bread
a lump of coal
crops can be great impairers of the soil
an inclusion in the cytoplasm of the cell
the valley of the Indus was the site of an early civilization
they discarded all their inessentials
Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Darien
he clutched a jag of the rock
the plane turned away from the sea and moved back over land
the earth shook for several minutes
he dropped the logs on the ground
the land had never been plowed
good agricultural soil
one of the tires developed a leak
Mars has two satellites
thousands of acres of marshland
the fens of eastern England
a huge ice mass
