wait just a moment
in a mo
it only takes a minute
in just a bit
if I had the chance I'd do it in a flash
ganoid fishes swarmed during the earlier geological periods
their goal was to reestablish the Caliphate
in the day of the dinosaurs
in the days of the Roman Empire
in the days of sailing ships
he was a successful pianist in his day
they had to wait a generation for that prejudice to fade
he'll get around to it in the sweet by-and-by
the industrial revolution opened a new chapter in British history
the divorce was an ugly chapter in their relationship
we live in a litigious age
the most recent ice age was during the Pleistocene
a relief pitcher took over in the top of the fifth
they played two sets of tennis after dinner
rain stopped play in the 4th inning
