it was a world record clocking
the job was finished in the span of an hour
there were stretches of boredom
he did a stretch in the federal penitentiary
on the geological time scale mankind has existed but for a brief moment

they work an 8-hour day
Thursday is his day off
his job left him little leisure
we get two weeks of vacation every summer
we took a short holiday in Puerto Rico
he came to visit at half-term
a ten day's leave to visit his mother
he had a pass for three days
the battery had a short life
