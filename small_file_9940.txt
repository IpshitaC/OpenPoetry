a morsel of paper was all he needed
only a handful of responses were received
he's coming for a couple of days
he had a drop too much to drink
a drop of each sample was analyzed
there is not a drop of pity in that man
years afterward, they would pay the blood-money, driblet by driblet"--Kipling
he got a load on and started a brawl
the system broke down under excessive loads
the storm brought several inches of precipitation
you don't know jack
he poured a shot of whiskey
he speaks French with a trace of an accent
a spark of interest
a spark of decency
a tot of rum
this dish could use a touch of garlic
a batch of letters
a deal of trouble
a lot of money
