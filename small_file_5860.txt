he was given credit for his work
give her credit for trying
a musical salute to the composer on his birthday
he asked permission to leave
he indicated his consent
the gave the green light for construction to begin
she was granted leave to speak
he had to show his pass in order to get out
the media representatives had special passes
the pass to visit had a strict time limit
the book met with modest acclaim
he acknowledged the plaudits of the crowd
they gave him more eclat than he really deserved
give the little lady a great big hand
there was a round of applause
let's give the team a big hurrah
there was a salvo of approval
he always appreciated praise for his work
they sang a hymn of praise to God
he gave it a rave
