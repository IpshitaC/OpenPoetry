George Washington is the father of his country
the framers of the Constitution
he was my best friend at the university
she got a reputation as a frump
she's a real dog
you may accuse me of being and old fuddy-duddy trying to stop young people having fun
fugitives from the sweatshops
a fugleman for the radical right
she was clearly the gainer in that exchange
there are too many gatekeepers between the field officers and the chief
they were a society of hunters and gatherers
he was the generator of several complaints
Mozart was a child genius
he's smart but he's no Einstein
a young lady of 18
Mrs. Smith was just one of the girls
his girlfriend kicked him out
Mary and her girlfriend organized the party
there are no greater givers than those who give themselves
he was a god among men
