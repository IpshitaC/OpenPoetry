room for improvement
let him have his say
he wanted a shot at the champion
he worked both sides of the street
cooperation is a two-way street
he couldn't afford $50 a throw
in the depths of despair
they were rescued from despair at the last minute
courage born of desperation
the plainness of vanilla ice cream
orders have recently picked up after a period of extreme softness
he attributes the disappointing results to softness in the economy
he is under an obligation to finish the job
he is badly in debt
an account in arrears
the problem was to match receivables and payables in the same currency
add it to my score and I'll settle later
great wealth is not a sign of great intelligence
they studied forerunners of richness or poverty
the richness all around unsettled him for he had expected to find poverty
