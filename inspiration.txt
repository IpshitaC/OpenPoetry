he always wrote down his New Year's resolutions
its adoption by society
the proposal found wide acceptance
his willing embrace of new ideas
in the bosom of the family

the winning goal came with less than a minute left to play
the own goal cost them the game
he finished with three strikes in the tenth frame
the break in the eighth frame cost him the match
