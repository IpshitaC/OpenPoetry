out of focus
the scene had the swirling vagueness of a painting by Turner
the fissiparity of religious sects
the dullness of the pencil made his writing illegible
the blatancy of his attempt to whitewash the crime was unforgivable
the predomination of blues gave the painting a quiet tone
he rose through the ranks with apparent ease
they put it into containers for ease of transportation
the very easiness of the deed held her back
such effortlessness is achieved only after hours of practice
they conversed with great facility
a happy readiness of conversation"--Jane Austen
the five-speed manual gearbox is smoothness personified
they agreed about the difficulty of the climb
the asperity of northern winters
the sternness of his surroundings made him uncomfortable
he assigned a series of problems of increasing hardness
the ruggedness of his exams caused half the class to fail
you had to admire the subtlety of the distinctions he drew
the movers cursed the unwieldiness of the big piano
