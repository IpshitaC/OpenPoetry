the gardener planted a bed of roses
the track bed had washed away
he used pliers as a bender
bentwood chairs
she wore her best bib-and-tucker
we followed the bier to the graveyard
he pulled down the bill of his cap and trudged ahead
he used a bill to prune branches off of the tree
the book had a leather binding
they feared use of the smallpox virus as a bioweapon
my father never spared the birch
he looked around for the right size bit
the horse was not accustomed to a bit
the widow wore black
he pulled the covers over his head and went to sleep
they had just moved in and had not put up blinds yet
he waited impatiently in the blind
the rapper was loaded with bling
the pyramids were built with large stone blocks
there is a block of classrooms in the west wing
