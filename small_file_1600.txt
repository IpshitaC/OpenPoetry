the priest sank to his knees in prayer
he returned to his devotions
the revival of trade
a revival of a neglected play by Moliere
the Gothic revival in architecture
it produced a resurrection of hope
although he was apparently drowned, resuscitation was accomplished by artificial respiration
she gave the trophy but he made the presentation
he is a master of disguise
no mask could conceal his ignorance
they moved in under a mask of friendship
the cover concealed their guns from enemy aircraft
her new name and passport are cover for her next assignment
the blue wall cracked when some officers refused to take part in the cover-up
requesting new powers of surveillance is just a smokescreen to hide their failures
it is the result of the juxtaposition of contrasting colors
a tessellation of hexagons
he ordered the planting of policemen outside every doorway
he gave a final set to his hat
they had a nice stay in Paris
