the historical context
it changed the ecology of the island
you can't do that in a university setting
the crowded canvas of history
the movie demanded a dramatic canvas of sound
home is where the heart is
he grew up in a good Christian home
there's no place like home
his social sphere is limited
it was a closed area of employment
he's out of my orbit
the Japanese were active last week on the diplomatic front
they advertise on many different fronts
the untroubled kingdom of reason
a land of make-believe
the rise of the realm of cotton in the south
the job fell right in my lap
there is nothing more I can do
medicine is no longer a male preserve
it was his province to take care of himself
