the situation soon took on a different color
the plaintiff claimed that under color of law the officer had deprived him of his civil rights

a pleasant countenance
a stern visage
a sad expression
a look of triumph
an angry face
chromosomes exhibit characteristic bands
the black and yellow banding of bees and wasps
they chipped off bark to mark the trail with blazes
the horse had a blaze between its eyes
the plane was just a speck in the sky
her red hat gave her outfit a splash of color
a bald spot
a leopard's spots
a patch of clouds
patches of thin ice
