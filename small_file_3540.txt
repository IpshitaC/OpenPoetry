it was beneath his dignity to cheat
showed his true dignity when under pressure
every subordinate sensed his contemptuousness and hated him in return
he hated the white man's superiority and condescension
not everyone regards humility as a virtue
his knowledgeability impressed me
his dullness was due to lack of initiation
a man of discernment
the crowd laughed at the absurdity of the clown's behavior
the Scots are famous for their economy
a life characterized by thriftlessness and waste
the wastefulness of missed opportunities
the experience destroyed his trust and personal dignity
his suspiciousness destroyed his marriage
neatness and fastidiousness of dress
the program was withdrawn because of the squeamishness of some viewers
he refused to allow squeamishness to deter him from his duty
he has the manners of a pig
award for good citizenship
it is not good form to brag about winning
