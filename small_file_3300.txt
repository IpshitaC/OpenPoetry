she wore a sort of magenta dress
she served a creamy sort of dessert thing
his contention contains more than an echo of Rousseau
Napoleon III was an echo of the mighty Emperor but an infinitely better man

the spread between lending and borrowing costs
he felt a gulf between himself and his former friends
