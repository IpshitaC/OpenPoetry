a surrogate mother is artificially inseminated with the father's semen and carries the fetus to term
he left his farm to his survivors
the survivors of the fire were taken to a hospital
he's a sweetheart
he is not a good swimmer
he was an Olympic swimmer
they called themselves the Dixie Syncopators
the right tackle is a straight A student
a theory that was simply added on by some anonymous tagger
finger tappers irritated her
it was his first start against his former teammates
Satan is the great tempter of mankind
the landlord can evict a tenant who doesn't pay the rent
there are not many fourth termers in the Senate
he was the terror of the neighborhood
the great minds of the 17th century
he's a tiger on the tennis court
it aroused the tiger in me
a generous tipper
