the house was built around an inner court
players had to reserve a court in advance
television cameras were admitted in the courtroom
the king will visit the duke's court
they made a cover of a Beatles' song
Cox-2 inhibitors reduce the symptoms of arthritis without endangering the stomach and kidneys
a cricket bat has a narrow handle and a broad flat end for hitting
the latest crop of fashions is about to hit the stores
he had the target in his cross hairs
tomorrow my dentist will fit me for a crown
he put the cup back in the saucer
the handle of the cup was missing
the school kept the cups is a special glass case
he swore as the ball rimmed the cup and rolled away
put the flag back in the cup
policemen stood at intervals along the curbside
a woman with her head full of curlers is not a pretty sight
he used a dampener to moisten the shirts before he ironed them
he bought a new daybook
they rode in a double-decker bus
