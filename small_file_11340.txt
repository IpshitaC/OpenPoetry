the fall quarter ends at Christmas
a healthy baby born at full term
the job will take more than an hour
the hour is getting late
it was their finest hour
the game was finished in regulation time
he ran a 4 minute mile
it's a quarter til 4
a quarter after 4 o'clock
the regular sequence of the seasons
in the fall of 1973
the emerging buds were a sure sign of spring
he will hold office until the spring of next year
they spent a lazy summer at the shore
they traveled to Europe in high season
it was the Christmas season
he celebrated his 10th season with the ballet company
she always looked forward to the avocado season
we've known each other for ages
I haven't been there for years and years
