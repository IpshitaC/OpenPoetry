he handled it with the preciseness of an automaton
note the meticulous precision of his measurements
I marveled at the trueness of his aim
misunderstandings can often be traced to a looseness of expression
biblical inerrancy

the shadiness of their transactions

he is remembered for his generosity and civilization

the simplicity and elegance of his invention
he wooed her with the confident dash of a cavalry officer
