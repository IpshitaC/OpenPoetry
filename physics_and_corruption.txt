the market took a downturn
he wrote the manual on car care
it was time for an overhaul on the tractor
the blighted neighborhood underwent a total makeover
the play had bookings throughout the summer
they played a gig in New Jersey
science has been blamed for the dehumanization of modern life
corruption of a minor
the big city's subversion of rural innocence
the etiolation of celery
the hairdresser gave her hair a modest tinting
he gave it a good drenching
the lawn needs a great deal of watering
baptized with a sprinkling of holy water
a sparge of warm water over the malt
ruminants have remarkable powers of rumination
police controlled the motion of the crowd
the movement of people from the farms to the cities
his move put him directly in my path
the movement of cargo onto the vessel
