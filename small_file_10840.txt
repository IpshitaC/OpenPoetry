debt-ridden farmers struggling with adversity
a life of hardship
his career was in the gutter
all that work went down the sewer
pensions are in the toilet
lack of funds has resulted in a catastrophe for our school system
his policies were a disaster
he was determined to fight to the bitter end
a ship in distress
she was the classic maiden in distress
a country in the throes of economic collapse
his victimization infuriated him
that is his cross to bear
he bears his afflictions like a crown of thorns
he felt that his entire life had been a failure
that year there was a crop failure
the company had to declare bankruptcy
fraudulent loans led to the failure of many banks
spiritual bankruptcy
moral bankruptcy
