he counted the ticks of the clock
he enjoyed hearing the tootles of their horns as the musicians warmed up
the tramp of military boots
he heard the trample of many feet
the noisy voice of the waterfall
the incessant voices of the artillery
whir of a bird's wings
the whir of the propellers
he heard the whiz of bullets near his head
the zing of the passing bullet
he could feel the beat of her heart
he felt a throbbing in his head
a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune" -Shakespeare
a leeward tide is dangerous for small boats
she adjusted the fan so that the airflow was directed right at her
the raft floated downstream on the current
he felt a stream of air
the hose ejected a stream of water
the houses were swept away in the torrent
he longed for the touch of her hand
