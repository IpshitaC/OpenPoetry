the expatriation of wealthy farmers
the sentence was one of transportation for life
he has been relegated to a post in Siberia
the termination of the agreement
his best finish in a major tournament was third
the speaker's finishing was greeted with applause
I appreciated his follow-through on his promise
his follow-through was straight down the line toward the target
squash can be dangerous if your opponent has a long follow-through
he emerged from his hibernation to make his first appearance in several years
the handover of occupied territory
he was granted immunity from prosecution
collusion resulted in tax fixes for gamblers
the doctrine of sovereign immunity originated with the maxim that the king can do no wrong
after 15 years together they are headed for splitsville
he died in a purge by Stalin
the pilot reported two kills during the mission
he had two deaths on his conscience
he avenged the bloodshed of his kinsmen
it is a crime to commit suicide
