He trusted her clear steadiness that she would do what she said
sturdiness of moral principle
a charming host without any touch of stiffness or pomposity
a man of unusual decisiveness
his determination showed in his every movement
he is a man of purpose
his diligence won him quick promotions
frugality and industry are still regarded as virtues
the intentness of his gaze
his singleness of purpose
the volatility of the market drove many investors away
the king's incurable indecisiveness caused turmoil in his court
his sincerity inspired belief
they demanded some proof of my sincerity
in sooth
the singleness of his motives could not be questioned
a man of honor
he expects to find in us the common honesty and integrity of men of business
they admired his scrupulous professional integrity
in a world where financial probity may not be widespread
