the radical character of our demands
the texture of Neapolitan life
the map showed roads and other features
generosity is one of his best characteristics
he studied every facet of the question
flowers are an attractor for bees
wearing a tie was regarded as a badge of respectability
education was the centerpiece of the Democratic Party's political platform
the contours of the melody
it defines a major contour of this administration
a center of manufacturing excellence
the use of herbs is one of the excellencies of French cuisine
he enjoyed the solemn externals of religion
bombs are a terrorist's calling cards
he was on the heavy side
he is on the purchasing side of the business
it brought out his better side
there is a downside even to motherhood
on the one hand..., but on the other hand...
he was helpless in an important sector of his life
