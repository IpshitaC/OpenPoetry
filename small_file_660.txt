the culprit started to run and the cop took off in pursuit
she needed a fix of chocolate
it was a difficult climb to the top
reaching the crest was a real clamber
they expected the drop would be successful
he landed on the bed with a great flop
they set out on their return to the base camp
his slide didn't stop until the bottom of the hill
the children lined up for a coast down the snowy slope
the knots allowed no slippage
the traffic advanced at a crawl
he initiated deceleration by braking
the transplant did not flower until the second year
too frequent transplanting is not good for families
she returned to Alabama because she could not bear transplantation
his constant shifting disrupted the class
the reflex motion of his eyebrows revealed his surprise
movement is a sign of life
an impatient move of his hand
gastrointestinal motility
