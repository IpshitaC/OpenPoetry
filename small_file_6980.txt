events suddenly took an awkward turn
recent developments in Iraq
what a revolting development!
the court's decision had many unforeseen ramifications
the industrial revolution was also a cultural revolution
attenuation in the volume of the sound
the fall of the House of Hapsburg
the anticlimax of a brilliant career
the term `distress' connotes some degree of perturbation and emotional upset
he looked around for the source of the disturbance
there was a disturbance of neural function
the first shock of the earthquake came shortly after noon while workers were at lunch
an invasion of tourists
an invasion of locusts
they got a bad connection and could hardly hear one another over the background signals
white noise is a good masking agent
there's a drip through the roof
an outburst of heavy rain
a burst of lightning
the outbreak of hostilities
