I establish the colors and principal values by organizing the painting into three values--dark, medium...and light"-Joe Hing Lowe
the sound of rain on the roof
the beautiful sound of music
it has the ring of sincerity
singing in unison
A shrill voice sounded behind us
he needed silence in order to sleep
the street was quiet
the still of the night
then another melodic line is added to the texture
he spoke in a low key
the Beijing dialect uses four tones
he cannot sing in tune
the clarinet was out of tune
the timbre of her soprano was rich and lovely
the muffled tones of the broken bell summoned them to meet
the recording fails to capture the true color of the original music
the music had a fullness that echoed through the hall
the cheap wine had no body, no mellowness
he was well aware of the richness of his own appearance
