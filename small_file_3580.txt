a place with the rurality of a turnip field
he has a stubborn streak
a streak of wildness
my only inheritance was my mother's blessing
the world's heritage of knowledge
he is a lawyer with a sports background
free public education is the birthright of every American child
a woman of breeding and refinement
he comes from good origins
it was replaced because of its age
his chronological age was 71 years
she liked the old cottage
she loved the freshness of newly baked bread
the freshness of the air revived him
crispness of new dollar bills
crispness of fresh lettuce
her dignified manner
his rapid manner of talking
their nomadic mode of existence
in the characteristic New York style
