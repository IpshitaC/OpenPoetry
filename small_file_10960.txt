gloom pervaded the office
the nakedness of the landscape
some people in publishing think of theirs as a glamorous medium so they copy the glitter of Hollywood
the novel spun a miasma of death and decay
the feel of the city excited him
a clergyman improved the tone of the meeting
it had the smell of treason
unsusceptibility to rust
these trees are widely planted because of their resistance to salt and smog
all his actions were in subservience to the general plan
the capability of a metal to be fused
the consumptive habitus
catalytic activity
any food produced irritation of the stomach
retroversion of the uterus
he confirmed the wetness of the swimming trunks
the baseball game was canceled because of the wateriness of the outfield
the water's muddiness made it undrinkable
the sloppiness of a rainy November day
drops of wet gleamed on the window
