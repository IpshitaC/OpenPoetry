his perfectionism seemed excessive to his students
all people should practice toleration and live together in peace
too much indulgence spoils a child
softness is not something permitted of good leaders
severity of character
the harshness of his punishment was inhuman
the rigors of boot camp
the victor's grace in treating the vanquished
his temper was well known to all his employees
his intolerance of interruptions
charges of litigiousness and widespread perjury
he expressed his willingness to help
readiness to continue discussions
they showed no eagerness to spread the gospel
they disliked his zeal in demonstrating his superiority
he tried to explain his forwardness in battle
he was testing the government's receptiveness to reform
this receptiveness is the key feature in oestral behavior, enabling natural mating to occur
their receptivity to the proposal
his unwillingness to cooperate vetoed every proposal I made
