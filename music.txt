he taught them the waltz step
they liked to dance the twist
his music was his central interest
he practiced his drumming several hours every day
with a shout and a song they marched up to the gates
her crooning soon put the child to sleep
his cheerful whistling indicated that he enjoyed his work
the signal was two beats on the steam pipe
he did a funny impression of a politician
his business with the cane was hilarious
play it straight with no shtik
we congratulated him on his performance at the rehearsal
an inspired performance of Mozart's C minor concerto
the program lasted more than two hours
heroics are for those epic films they make in Hollywood
the reenactment of the battle of Princeton
it was so funny it was a circus
the whole occasion had a carnival atmosphere
the disorganization of the enemy troops by a flank attack
the social dislocations resulting from government policies
