he got two flunks on his report
all my efforts led to naught
he was punished for taking too many cuts in his math class
he lost the game by default
everyone expected him to win so his loss was a shock
they were protected until the capitulation of the fort
the biggest upset since David beat Goliath
he made a bad mistake
she was quick to point out my errors
I could understand his English in spite of his grammatical faults
the second baseman made a bobble but still had time to throw the runner out
he made a huge blot on his copybook
he changed his name in order to avoid confusion with the notorious outlaw
the error in the calculation was attributable to rounding
taxes are rounded off to the nearest dollar but the rounding error is surprisingly small
he made a bad bull of the assignment
he dropped a clanger
he recited the whole poem without a single trip
he arranged his robes to avoid a trip-up later
confusion caused his unfortunate misstep
