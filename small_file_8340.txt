an area rich in archaeological findings
the fire pit of the crater
the salt flats of Utah
the fire spared the forest floor
the floor of the pelvis
the floor of the cave
many campsites were located near the flowage
the beer had a thick head of foam
Ponce de Leon discovered Florida while searching for the Fountain of Youth
a fragment of rock
a grain of sand
a grain of sugar
the greenwood was Robin Hood's home
vegetable grindings clogged the drain
it is a Middle Eastern custom to read your future in your coffee grounds
a growth of hair
a hail of pebbles
a hail of bullets
the beer had a large head of foam
the head of a comet
