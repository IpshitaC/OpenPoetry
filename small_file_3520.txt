he enjoys an exaggerated reputation for probity
he acted in good faith
doubt was expressed as to the good faith of the immigrants
the girl's motherliness made her invaluable in caring for the children
the gentleness and fatherliness of the strange old man eased her fears
an embarrassing sleaziness that I hope will be corrected by the more ethical newspapers
the speciousness of his argument
they rode the same wave of popular patriotism
British nationalism was in the air and patriotic sentiments ran high
the widespread disaffection of the troops
the innocencies of childhood
they took advantage of her simplicity
he insisted on discipline among the troops
he was a model of polite restraint
she never lost control of herself
an effective temperateness in debate
the British like to keep a stiff upper lip
she danced with abandon
the flexibility and looseness of the materials from which mythology is made
poetry is a sort of divine madness
