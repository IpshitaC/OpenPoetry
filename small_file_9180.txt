a good sport
a poor sport
he is such a sprawler he needs a bed to himself
she was known as a spurner of all suitors
he was no spurner of rules
my spies tell me that you had a good time last night
she was his main squeeze
the allowed number of standees is posted
a crowd of sitters and standers
the star had a stand-in for dangerous scenes
we need extra employees for summer fill-ins
Keystone stater
farm staters
a stickler for promptness
a lucky stiff
a working stiff
he is a real conversation stifler
I see from all the yawn smotherers that it is time to stop
an outside stocktaker had to be hired
a Stoic achieves happiness by submission to destiny
