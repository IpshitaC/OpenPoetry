abdominal breathing is practiced by singers
he went outside for a smoke
smoking stinks
they smoked up the room with their ceaseless puffing
he took a deep breath and dived into the pool
he was fighting to his last breath
he gave his nose a loud blow
he blew out all the candles with a single puff
the collision knocked the wind out of him
she gave a gasp and fainted
he could not suppress a yawn
the yawning in the audience told him it was time to stop
he apologized for his oscitancy
he took a puff on his pipe
he took a drag on his cigarette and expelled the smoke slowly
the boys took a few tokes on a joint
subjects received a small electric shock when they made the wrong response
electricians get accustomed to occasional shocks
one swallow of the liquid was enough
he took a drink of his beer and smacked his lips
