they used spikes to fasten the rails to a railroad tie
the spike pierced the receipts and held them in order
one of the spikes impaled him
the second baseman sharpened his spikes before every game
golfers' spikes damage the putting greens
the title and author were printed on the spine of the book
the break was due to an imperfect splice
he was winning until he got a split in the tenth frame
night spot
an eight-spot
he used his knife as a spreader
the spring was broken
cowboys know not to squat with their spurs on
Sputnik was the first man-made satellite to orbit the earth
the carpenter who built this room must have lost his square
a checkerboard has 64 squares
those sneakers are squeakers
which hinge is the squeaker?
he walked with the help of a wooden staff
he clambered up onto the stage and got the actors to help him into the box
