they had a bitter exchange
let's have more work and less talk around here
he took me aside for a little heart-to-heart
that's a lot of wind
don't give me any of that jazz
they traded a few nothings as they parted
he whispered sweet nothings into her ear
the essay contained too much detail
the book contains an excellent discussion of modal logic
his treatment of the race question is badly biased
consideration of the traffic problem took more than an hour
his poetry contains much talk about love and anger
expressions of good will
he helped me find verbal expression for my ideas
the idea was immediate but the verbalism took hours
I told him cold turkey
I sent them my sincere congratulations on their marriage
we had a good discussion
we had a word or two about it
the argument over foreign aid goes on and on
