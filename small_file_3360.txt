due to the rockiness of the land it was quickly dry even after a heavy rain
the ruggedness of the mountains
the hilliness of West Virginia
there was too much play in the steering wheel
the restlessness of the wind
the Spanish ships had superior speed and weatherliness
he walked with the wiggliness of a child on high heels
he hadn't counted on the slackness of the rope
the shakiness of the present regime
the lodgment of the balloon in the tree
a man of granite
sureness of hand
he was charmed by the sweetness of her manner
the pleasantness of a cool breeze on a hot summer day
a well trained staff saw to the agreeableness of our accommodations
he discovered the amenities of reading at an early age
the enjoyableness of an afternoon at the beach
the recent unpleasantness of the weather
the policy's unpalatability caused an uproar
I flinched at the nastiness of his wound
