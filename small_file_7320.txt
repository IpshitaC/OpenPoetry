I asked for a hot drink
likes a drink before dinner
he stopped at the bar for a quick refresher
he ordered a whiskey neat
the advantages of instant coffee are speed of preparation and long shelf life
he took a slug of hard liquor
in New England they call sodas tonics
he ordered a cup of coffee
the store shelves held many different kinds of tea
they threw the tea into Boston harbor
iced tea is a cooling drink
he asked for a drink of water
he lived on the thin slops that food kitchens provided
a lobster mold
a gelatin dessert made in a mold
a flower arrangement
a straggle of outbuildings
a straggle of followers
an array of troops in battle order
the dichotomy between eastern and western culture
