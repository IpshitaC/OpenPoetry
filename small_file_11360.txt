I hadn't seen him in a month of Sundays
in the long run we will win
in the long run we will all be dead
he performed well over the long haul
oh, that happened eons ago
something that happens once in blue moon almost never happens
he has been a conductor since the year dot
when England defeated Pakistan it ended a ten-year drought
the moment he arrived the party began
money became available at the eleventh hour
at the last minute the government changed the rules
they were strangers sharing a pinpoint of time together
it is time to go
it is high time you went to work
on the occasion of his 60th birthday
bide a wee
he was here for a little while
I need to rest for a piece
a spell of good weather
a patch of bad weather
