the blandness of his confession enraged the judge
a distressing coldness of tone and manner
he must have a heart of stone
her face was as hard as stone
her manner assumed a dispassion and dryness very unlike her usual tone
flowers added a note of cheerfulness to the drab room
it was a heavy play and the actors tried in vain to give life to it
there was a pertness about her that attracted him
he accepted with alacrity
the smartness of the pace soon exhausted him
his writing conveys great energy
a remarkable muscularity of style
a performance of great elan and sophistication
a delightful breeziness of manner
I admired his buoyancy and persistent good humor
this tonic is guaranteed to give you more pep
the level of activity declines with age
he had to overcome his inertia and get back to work
the general appearance of sluggishness alarmed his friends
he longed for the restfulness of home
