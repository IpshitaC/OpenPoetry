a profession of disagreement
his threat to kill me was quite explicit
he spoke with desperate menace
his declaration of innocence
he didn't say a word about it
the explanation was very simple
I expected a brief account
he was unable to give a clear accounting for his actions
certain representations were made concerning police brutality
the reason a steady state was never reached was that the back pressure built up too slowly
he had no cause to complain
they had good reason to rejoice
he offered a persuasive defense of the theory
he kept finding excuses to stay
every day he had a new alibi for not getting a job
his transparent self-justification was unacceptable
we would have understood the play better if there had been some initial exposition of the background
his constant moralizing drove me mad
they were trying to find a peaceful solution
the answers were in the back of the book
