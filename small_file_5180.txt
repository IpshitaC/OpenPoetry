my father's philosophy of child-rearing was to let mother do it
my opinion differs from yours
I am not of your persuasion
what are your thoughts on Haiti?
he lost his faith but not his morality
devoted to the cultus of the Blessed Virgin
it was a satanic cult
in the eyes of the law
I was wrong in her eyes
he asked for a poll of public opinion
he did not even try to confirm his preconceptions
they are at opposite poles
they are poles apart
there is little or no promise that he will recover
chasing rainbows
this room has great possibilities
each of them had their own anticipations
an indicator of expectancy in development
white supremacism
the architect has a theory that more is less
