the conductor set the beat
the tabloids relied on sensationalism to maintain their circulation
John's succinct turn of phrase persuaded her that it would not be a good idea
he could always come up with some inspired off-the-wall conceit
the crispness of his reply
he continued in this vein for several minutes
a tiny little child
to say that something is `adequate enough' is a tautology
the statement `he is brave or he is not brave' is a tautology
the British get `pud' from `pudding' by apocope
the essay was in the form of a dialogue
he first sketches the plot in outline form
around the rock the ragged rascal ran
`ended' and `blended' form a double rhyme
My own heart's heart
O tempore! O mores
Seems, madam! Nay, it is
saying `I was not a little upset' when you mean `I was very upset' is an example of litotes
`Mr. Pickwick took his hat and his leave' is an example of zeugma
his speech was garbled
