most soldiers are only boys in uniform
the way of transgressors is hard
maliks rule the hinterland of Afghanistan under the protection of warlords
there were two women and six men on the bus
she takes good care of her man
the army will make a man of you
it was every man for himself
the chief stationed two men outside the building
he awaited word from his man in Havana
she was too fat to be a mannequin
every man jack
he is a good map-reader
when the tide came in I was a maroon out there
we invited several young marrieds
he loved the mare and all her mates
camels hate leaving their mates
he was university material
she was vice-presidential material
Jack Dempsey was called a mauler
he consulted several mediums
