they sat by the fire and talked
he wore his firearm in a shoulder holster
the fireplace was so large you could walk inside it
he laid a fire in the hearth and lit it
the hearth was black with the charcoal of many fires
she liked the kitchen fitments
an elaborate formal dinner with all the fixings
he bought a Christmas tree and trimmings to decorate it
the flagging in the garden was quite imaginative
it is their flagship newspaper
he wrote on the flap of the envelope
red flashes adorned the airplane
a flash sewn on his sleeve indicated the unit he belonged to
they needed rugs to cover the bare floors
we spread our sleeping bags on the dry floor of the tent
what level is the office on?
he is a floor trader
there was a motion from the floor
the photographic film was wrapped in foil
the first folio of Shakespeare's plays
