automation replaces human workers by machines
after reaching the desired velocity the drive is cut off
he moved the throttle to the firewall
the impulse knocked him over
the catcher made a good throw to second base
he gave it a mighty heave
he was not good at heaving passes
the pass was fumbled
his pitch fell short and his hat landed on the floor
he gave the ball a shy to the first baseman
he threw nine straight balls before the manager yanked him
he swung late on the fastball
he showed batters nothing but smoke
this pitcher throws more strikes than balls
his shot hit the rim and bounced out
he gave the door a hard push
the pushing is good exercise
depression of the space bar on the typewriter
a click on the right button for example
he gave the button a press
