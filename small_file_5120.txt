a petty argument about semantics
the significance of his remark became clear only later
the expectation was spread both by word and by implication
the gist of the prosecutor's argument
the heart and soul of the Republican Party
the nub of the story
he told us only the bare bones of the story
suspense is the very stuff of narrative
although I disagreed with him I could follow the tenor of his argument
caught the general drift of the conversation
the extension of `satellite of Mars' is the set containing only Demos and Phobos
he argued that reference is a consequence of conditioned reflexes
he has old-fashioned values
academic education is the gold standard against which other educational activity is pejoratively judged
they live by the standards of their community
the job specifications summarized the design criteria
an exemplar of success
a model of clarity
he is the very model of a modern major general
his roses were beauties
