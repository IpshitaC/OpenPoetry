I was recalled to the present by the apparition of a frightening specter
the germination of their discontent
he got in on the ground floor
figurines presage the emergence of sculpture in Greece
it was off to a good start
the onset of pneumonia
the dawn of civilization
the morning of the world
she played Chopin for her opener
the season's opener was a game against the Yankees
they are trying to determine the cause of the crash
training is a necessary preliminary to employment
drinks were the overture to dinner
the emanation of the Holy Spirit
the rising of the Holy Ghost
the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son
a number of factors determined the outcome
fundamentals include a company's growth, revenues, earnings, management, and capital structure
I don't know what the new man will do
the weather was a wild card
