it resulted in a complete denial of his privileges
abnegation of the Holy Trinity
he answered in the negative
his no was loud and clear
the nays have it
I don't never go
A not unwelcome outcome
the repudiation of the debt by the city
he spoke as if he thought his claims were immune to contradiction
the statement `he is brave and he is not brave' is a contradiction
Congressional repudiation of the treaty that the President had negotiated
they made short shrift of my request
he expressed his dissent in a contrary opinion
his authority is beyond exception
a mere caption unworthy of a reply
I have a gripe about the service here
they finished the game under protest to the league president
the senator rose to register his protest
the many protestations did not stay the execution
he shouted his protests at the umpire
