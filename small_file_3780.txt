the manager had only four starting pitchers in his rotation
they won the championship three years in a row
the play had a long run on Broadway
the team enjoyed a brief run of victories
the approach of winter
the forwardness of the harvest this year
the arts are in no kind of forwardness in this matter
the interval determining the coincidence gate is adjustable
the two spoke in unison
a study of the pastness of the present and...of the presentness of the past"- R.E.Spiller
the currency of a slang term
a shopping mall would instill a spirit of modernity into this village
the ceremony was of short duration
he complained about the length of time required
her longevity as a star
had unusual longevity in the company
the shortness of air travel time
they advertised the durability of their products
he advertised the imperishability of the product
they could sense radiation in the infrared
