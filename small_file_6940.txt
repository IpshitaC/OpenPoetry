the cooling touch of the night air
the sudden knock floored him
he took a bash right in his face
he got a bang on the head
the reversal of the image in the lens
the shimmer of colors on iridescent feathers
the play of light on the water
the population explosion
the information explosion
a jump in attendance
a runup in interest rates
market runups are followed by corrections
the waxing of the moon
he still remembers their meeting in Paris
there was a brief encounter in the hallway
the transmutation of base metals into gold proved to be impossible
at such junctures he always had an impulse to leave
it was needed only on special occasions
the climax of the artist's career
in the flood tide of his success
