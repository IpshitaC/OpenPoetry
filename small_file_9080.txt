he was a sugar refiner
an habitue of the racetrack
a bum who is a Central Park fixture
he is one of the party regulars
his reincarnation as a lion
a reliever of anxiety
an allayer of fears
a statistician has to be something of a generalist
the audience consisted largely of repeaters who had seen the movie many times
X is no respecter of Y
the clubs attract revelers as young as thirteen
Jack the Ripper was probably a madman
he's usually a late riser
he had respect for his rivals
he wanted to know what the competition was doing
the honoree gave his roasters as good as he got
he was her rock during the crisis
Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church"--Gospel According to Matthew
you do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure that out
only a rotter would do that
