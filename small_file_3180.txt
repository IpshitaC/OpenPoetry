fine clothes could not conceal the girl's homeliness
a facial blemish
there was a crack in the mirror
the book was in good condition except for a dig in the back cover
a cigarette burn on the edge of the table
he had a smudge on his cheek
the wine left a dark stain
pressure causes plantar warts to develop a painful callus around the soft center
the room was simply decorated with great restraint
I was struck by the starkness of my father's room
he wrote with great flamboyance
his etiolation signaled years in prison
the boat had a metallic finish
he applied a coat of a clear finish
when the finish is too thin it is difficult to apply evenly
his trousers had a sharp crease and you could see your reflection in his shoeshine
when she awoke the clarity was back in her eyes
a windshield with good visibility
exercise had given his muscles superior definition
in focus
