I gave the waiter my order
the company's products were in such demand that they got more orders than their call center could handle
she gave me a walk-through of my new duties
he always greeted me with a new zinger
she tried to think of some killer of an argument, a real zinger that would disarm all opposition
first was the lightning and then its thunderous associate
the program brought an avalanche of mail
when the rain came he could hear the sound of thunder in the background
a surprising experience
that painful experience certainly got our attention
is it better to view the appalling or merely hear of it?
he hoped it was an augury
it was a sign from God
he looked for an omen before going into battle
a flash of emotion swept over him
the flashings of pain were a warning
we had a good time at the party
celebrating after the game was a blast
he sympathized on the loss of their grandfather
he got a taste of life on the wild side
