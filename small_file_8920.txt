it was a leviathan among redwoods
they were assigned the leviathan of textbooks
his heroism saved a life
plaintiffs and defendants are both litigants
my little brother just had his 50th birthday
a liver in cities
a high liver
a longer for money
a thirster after blood
a yearner for knowledge
a low-birth-weight infant is at risk for developing lack of oxygen during labor
he was host to a large gathering of luminaries
the light of my life
Yankee Doodle stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni
the boxer was a magnificent fighting machine
a master of the violin
one of the old masters
she is a linguistics major
the baby was a boy
she made the boy brush his teeth every night
