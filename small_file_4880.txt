the elicitation of his testimony was not easy
a sidecar is a smooth drink but it has a powerful kick
his approval was an added fillip
a joy to behold
the pleasure of his company
the new car is a delight
washing dishes was a nuisance before we got a dish washer
a bit of a bother
he's not a friend, he's an infliction
the continued existence of an abatable nuisance is not authorized under the law
their swimming pool is an attractive nuisance
a public nuisance offends the public at large
he's a thorn in my flesh
those children are a damn plague
New York traffic is a constant concern
it's a major worry
the old bugaboo of inflation still bothers them
the burden of responsibility
that's a load off my mind
it's none of your business
