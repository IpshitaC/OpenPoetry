he made a mint on the stock market
see the rest of the winners in our huge passel of photos
it must have cost plenty
a slew of journalists
a wad of money
a battalion of ants
a multitude of TV antennas
a plurality of religions
British say `it rained like billyo' where Americans say `it rained like all get out'
he imported wine by the boatload
a flood of requests
a torrent of abuse
he missed by a mile
there were millions of flies
they did much for humanity
he faced a myriad of details
a reservoir of talent
he wrote reams and reams
he made a small fortune in the commodities market
made lots of new friends
