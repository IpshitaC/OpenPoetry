his manner of speaking was quite abrupt
her speech was barren of southernisms
I detected a slight accent in his speech
the saltiness of their language was inappropriate
self-parody and saltiness riddled their core genre
the articulation of my feelings
I gave voice to my feelings
use concise military verbiage"- G.S.Patton
he spoke with a thick tongue
she has a glib tongue
he began in a conversational tone
he spoke in a nervous tone of voice
there was a note of uncertainty in his voice
there is a musky roundness to his wordiness
spoke in undertones
a barrage of questions
a bombardment of mail complaining about his mistake
he put the stress on the wrong syllable
the rhythm of Frost's poetry
the piece has a fast rhythm
