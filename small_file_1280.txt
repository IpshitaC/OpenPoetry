he prepared for great undertakings
this project is his baby
he had doubts about the whole enterprise
securing adequate funding is a time-consuming proposition
finishing in time was a tall order but we did it
he supported populist campaigns
they worked in the cause of world peace
the team was ready for a drive toward the pennant
the movement to end slavery
contributed to the war effort
William McKinley's dignified front-porch campaign won him the presidency in 1896
her approach was the opposite of a passive front-porch campaign
the reforms he proposed were too radical for the politicians
the war on poverty
the war against crime
a sally into the wide world beyond his home
he saw the rewards but not the risks of crime
there was a danger he would do the wrong thing
you take a chance when you let her drive
getting admitted to the college of your choice has become a crapshoot
