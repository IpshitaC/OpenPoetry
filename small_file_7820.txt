the entrance was guarded by ranks of policemen
he added a column of numbers
caught in the police dragnet
the complex machinery of negotiation
the machinery of command labored and brought forth an order
he owned a network of shops
retirement meant dropping out of a whole network of people who had been part of my life
tangled in a web of cloth
professional women have developed an old boy network of their own
a vast system of production and distribution and consumption keep the country going
the social organism
a body of law
a body of doctrine
a body of precedents
he represented the craft of brewers
as they say in the trade
Pleistocene vegetation
the flora of southern California
the botany of China
a deer needs to eat twenty pounds of browse every day
