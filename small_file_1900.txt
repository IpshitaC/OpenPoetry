it gave comfort to the enemy
he gave her a boost over the fence
the sight of flowers every morning was my morale builder
his presence was a consolation to her
the president no longer has the support of his own party
they developed a scheme of mutual support
attachment to a formal agenda
adherence to a fat-free diet
the adhesion of Seville was decisive
their ecclesiasticism overwhelmed their religion
his vigorous backing of the conservatives got him in trouble with progressives
the warmongers kept up their drumbeat on Iraq
insistence on grammatical correctness is a conservative position
the tournament was held under the auspices of the city council
a star athlete can make a lot of money from endorsements
he gave the project his blessing
his decision merited the approval of any sensible person
his support kept the family together
they gave him emotional support during difficult times
they were in want of sustenance
