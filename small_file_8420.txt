we got through the pass before it started to snow
the hurricane demolished houses in its path
the track of an animal
the course of the river
a perforation of the eardrum
they dug a pit to bury the body
they emerged from the woods onto a vast open plain
he longed for the fields of his youth
Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930
they sailed south around the point
the pond was too small for sailing
there were puddles of muddy water in the road after the rain
the body lay in a pool of blood
he pounded it to a pulp
quarks have not been observed directly but theoretical predictions based on their existence have been confirmed experimentally
the soul is the quickener of the body
the valley was between two ranges of hills
the plains lay just beyond the mountain range
music is a good relaxer
I threw out the remains of my dinner
