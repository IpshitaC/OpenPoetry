he finally got his big break
the election was just a lottery to them
he blamed his slip on the ice
the jolt caused many slips and a few spills
the surprise party was a complete failure
the spectacular flame-out of the company's stock cost many people their life savings
the right front tire had a blowout
as a result of the blowout we lost all the lights
the plane went into a stall and I couldn't control it
let's call heads a success and tails a failure
the election was a remarkable success for the Whigs
the rock concert was a real barnburner
they wished him Godspeed
not a day's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins
they celebrated the birth of their first child
she had a difficult delivery
the reappearance of Halley's comet
he missed the test and had to take a makeup
the two teams played a makeup one week later
a manifestation of great emotion
