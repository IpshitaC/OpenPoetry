cytoplasmic basophilia
a man of many desires
a thirst for knowledge
hunger for affection
this piano has a wonderful touch
the wall had a smooth texture
admiring the slim smoothness of her thighs
some artists prefer the smoothness of a board
he could feel the slickness of the tiller
she could smell the soapiness of the doctor's hands
the fineness of the sand on the beach
the optics of a telescope
the sleekness of his appearance reminded me of his financial successes
saw the board across the grain
he could paint the lightest light and the darkest dark
a glare of sunlight
he had a sparkle in his eye
there's a perpetual twinkle in his eyes
the brightness of the orange sky was reflected in the dullness of the orange sea
the softness of the morning sky
