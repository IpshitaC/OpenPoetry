he slammed the door as he left
his office is the third door down the hall on the left
the office next door
they live two doors up the street from us
he stuck his head in the doorway
Vibramycin is the trade name of doxycycline
he took a sleeping draft
he went to the party dressed in drag
the waitresses looked like missionaries in drag
he got a pair of kings in the draw
the luck of the draw
they drew lots for it
drawings of abstract forms
he did complicated pen-and-ink drawings like medieval miniatures
he pulled the drawstring and closed the bag
they dug a drift parallel with the vein
when it rained water would fall from the drip loop before it reached the building
the riverside drive offers many exciting scenic views
a variable speed drive permitted operation through a range of speeds
they parked in the driveway
