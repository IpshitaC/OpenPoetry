we took a quick circuit of the park
a ten-day coach circuit of the island
they took the show on the road
they lost all their games on the road
many summer excursions to the shore
it was merely a pleasure trip
after cautious sashays into the field
he took the dogs for an airing
they are on the way
in 1912 the ocean liner Titanic sank on its maiden voyage
he is studying for the ministry
we saved money by bareboating
the plane was late and he missed his connection in Atlanta
his reluctant delivery of bad news
until then, front line troops will be supplied by airdrop
it came by the first post
if you hurry you'll catch the post
he accepted service of the subpoena
the relay was successful
the backpacking of oxygen is essential for astronauts
