the antenna received signals with no directivity
the tower had a pronounced tilt
the ship developed a list to starboard
he walked with a heavy inclination to the right
a five-degree gradient
the road had a steep grade
the roof had a steep pitch
the oblateness of the planet
the position of the hands on the clock
he specified the spatial relations of every piece of furniture on the stage
the arrangement of the furniture
the placement of the chairs
harmonious composition is essential in a serious work of art
in all perfectly beautiful objects there is found the opposition of one part to another and a reciprocal balance"- John Ruskin
out of true
he waited for the coincidence of the target and the cross hairs
the outwardness of the world
the inwardness of the body's organs
houses with a pronounced horizontality
he assumed an attitude of surrender
