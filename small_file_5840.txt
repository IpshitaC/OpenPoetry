his first job was a crash course in survival and in learning how to get along with people
a crash programme is needed to create new jobs
we've got to get that story into print
his book is no longer in print
I want to see it in print
he needed his glasses in order to read the fine print
the news of my death was greatly exaggerated
the report of his speech
the story was on the 11 o'clock news
the account of his speech that was given on the evening news made the governor furious
he got a scoop on the bribery of city officials
they accused the paper of biased coverage of race relations
a profession of Christianity
he gave us the news and made a great show of the giving
giving his word of honor seemed to come too easily
there is no guarantee that they are not lying
words of approval seldom passed his lips
a Democrat usually gets the union's endorsement
they gave us the O.K. to go ahead
give her recognition for trying
