private airplanes are a rich man's toy
a toy stove
a trackball is essentially an upside-down mouse
the accident blocked all traffic at the rotary
that car is in the wrong traffic lane
express trains don't stop at Princeton Junction
the bride's train was carried by her two young nephews
a tramcar carries coal out of a coal mine
the trimming on a hat
the trim on a shirt
the pressure activates the tripper and releases the water
he used a spinner as his troll
in his trouser's pocket
he ripped his left trouser on the fence
he had a sharp crease in his trousers
clubs were declared trumps
a trump can take a trick even when a card of a different suit is led
the ace of trumps is a sure winner
the swagman filled his tuckerbag
the tunnel reduced congestion at that intersection
