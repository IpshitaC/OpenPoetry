a wave of emotion swept over him
there was a sudden wave of buying before the market closed
a wave of conservatism in the country led by the hard right
excitement grew as the finish neared
my horse was several lengths behind at the finish
the winner is the team with the most points at the finish
the game ended in a draw
their record was 3 wins, 6 losses and a tie
he was happy to get the win
the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end"--Revelation
his conversion to the Catholic faith
her death came as a terrible shock
upon your decease the capital will pass to your grandchildren
there was a decrease in his temperature as the fever subsided
there was a sharp drop-off in sales
after several hours of sinking an unexpected rally rescued the market
he could not control the sinking of his legs
the increase is scheduled for next month
a war of attrition
the new management was like a breath of fresh air
