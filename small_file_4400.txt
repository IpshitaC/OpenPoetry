danger heightened his powers of discrimination
every good mechanic has a large bag of tricks
he believed that leadership can be taught
he's got plenty of brains but no common sense
a teacher must have a breadth of knowledge of the subject
a man distinguished by the largeness and scope of his views
the very capaciousness of the idea meant that agreement on fundamentals was unnecessary
his unselfishness gave him great intellectual roominess
he reads to improve his mind
he has a keen intellect
nimbleness of wit and imagination
coruscations of great wit
he argued with great acuteness
I admired the keenness of his mind
he's as sharp as a steel trap
a mind like a steel trap
he used his wits to get ahead
I was scared out of my wits
he still had all his marbles and was in full possession of a lively mind
the spawning instinct in salmon
