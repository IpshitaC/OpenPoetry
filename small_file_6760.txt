wrack and ruin
the evanescence of the morning mist
he regretted the disappearance of Greek from school curricula
what was responsible for the disappearance of the rainforest?
the disappearance of resistance at very low temperatures
a period marked by adversities
I cannot think it a hardship that more indulgence is allowed to men than to women"- James Boswell
the many hardships of frontier life
the school of hard knocks
the vagaries of the weather
his wealth fluctuates with the vagaries of the stock market
he has dealt with human vagaries for many years
the project was subject to the usual vicissitudes of exploratory research
the engagement of the clutch
the meshing of gears
he gave it a flick with his finger
he felt the flick of a whip
the bump threw him off the bicycle
the door closed with a jolt
all the jars and jolts were smoothed out by the shock absorbers
