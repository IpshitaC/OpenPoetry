the deterrent power of nuclear weapons
the power of his love saved her
his powerfulness was concealed by a gentle facade
the preponderance of good over evil
the preponderance of wealth and power
the puissance of the labor vote
the strength of his argument settled the matter
they said nothing of great interest
primary colors can add interest to a room
the judge conceded the newsworthiness of the trial
he is no longer news in the fashion world
the library had to discard books that had lost their topicality
the Puritan Period was lacking in color
the characters were delineated with exceptional vividness
the shrillness of her hair color
corporations have a stranglehold on the media
the president applied a chokehold to labor disputes that inconvenienced the public
used her parents' influence to get the job
the force of his eloquence easily persuaded them
a good grip on French history
