the architect left space in front of the building
they stopped at an open space in the jungle
the space between his teeth
hunger had caused the hollows in their cheeks
the ball hit the pocket and gave him a perfect strike
a row of points
draw lines between the dots
genealogical tree
pottery of this cast was found throughout the region
he broke off one of the branches
they took the south fork
he climbed into the crotch of a tree
the trapped miners found a pocket of air
tongues of flame licked at the walls
rifles exploded quick knives of fire into the dark
it was several days after the storm before they could repair the washout and open the road
there was a cleavage between the liberal and conservative members
a happy medium
the human condition
a condition (or state) of disrepair
