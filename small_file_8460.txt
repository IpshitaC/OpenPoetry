a segment of an orange
the old salt had sailed the seven seas
the dog's woolly shag
a sheet of ice
the satellite is covered with a smooth shell of ice
alcohol is a great shortener of life
there was a thin skim of oil on the water
suddenly they were in a slack and the water was motionless
he climbed the steep slope
the house was built on the side of a mountain
he followed the deer's slot over the soft turf to the edge of the trees
the main body of the sound ran parallel to the coast
a truck bearing a mound of blue spalls
he lit the fire with a burning splint
he got a splinter in his finger
it broke into slivers
he inserted the wedge into a split in the log
the hounds followed the fox's spoor
I followed in his steps
he retraced his steps
