he read the mystery at one sitting
he wanted his portrait painted but couldn't spare time for the sitting
he gave his fingers a snap
a sweep of his arm
with a quick twist of his head he surveyed the room
he put the key in the old clock and gave it a good wind
a toss of his head
a wave of settlers
troops advancing in waves
he made an abrupt turn away from her
constant stirring prevents it from burning on the bottom of the pan
vigorous worrying finally loosened the saw
he was badly bruised by the upset of his sled at a high speed
the outreach toward truth of the human spirit
the number of keystrokes was used as a measure of work
he took a turn to the right
a diversion from the main highway
a digression into irrelevant details
a deflection from his goal
take a right at the corner
