the greater the number of pixels per inch the greater the resolution
a place setting of sterling flatware
the plans for City Hall were on file
the cabinetmaker used a plane for the finish work
they built a large plant to manufacture automobiles
there were cracks in the plaster
the speaker mounted the platform
a good plaza should have a movie house
they spent their weekends at the local malls
three-ply cord
four-ply yarn
a p-n junction has marked rectifying characteristics
he stuck the point of the knife into a tree
he broke the point of his pencil
he held me up at the point of a gun
the child was eating pottage from a porringer
the portals of the cathedral
the portals of heaven
the portals of success
he remembered her because she was carrying a large portfolio
