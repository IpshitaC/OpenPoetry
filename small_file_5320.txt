the reason that the agency is doomed to inaction has something to do with the FBI culture
the Kalashnikov culture in Afghanistan
the city's mosaic culture results in great diversity in the arts
they play hardball in the Senate
get off your high horse and admit you are wrong
the governor took a hard line on drugs
he had an inclination to give up too easily
a tendency to be too strict
I couldn't follow the direction of his thoughts
his ideals determined the direction of his career
they proposed a new direction for the firm
nothing disturbed the even tenor of her ways
not openly liberal but that is the trend of the book
a broad movement of the electorate to the right
the gravitation of the middle class to the suburbs
he was disappointed that he had not heard the Call
eventually the family left the house to the devices of this malevolent force
the children were left to their own devices
his sympathies were always with the underdog
I knew I could count on his understanding
