he preferred his erroneous but pleasing mumpsimus to the correct sumpsimus
the immigrants spoke an odd dialect of English
he has a strong German accent
it has been said that a language is a dialect with an army and navy
they don't speak our lingo
Cockney rhyming slang
their speech was full of slang expressions
he whispered a spell as he moved his hands
inscribed around its base is a charm in Balinese
a witch put a curse on his whole family
he put the whammy on me
they listened to her proposal
he was ready to pop the question
it was a suggestion we couldn't refuse
they resisted the introduction of impractical alternatives
they avoided a re-introduction of the old terminology
he made a motion to adjourn
she called for the question
not a breath of scandal ever touched her
there was a touch of sarcasm in his tone
