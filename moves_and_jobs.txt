I could tell from their headshakes that they didn't believe me
he warned me with a jab with his finger
he made a thrusting motion with his fist
an inclination of his head indicated his agreement
he gave me a short bob of acknowledgement
the kick must be synchronized with the arm movements
the swimmer's kicking left a wake behind him
the pitching and tossing was quite exciting
the ray of light revealed his cautious opening of the door
the company is looking for stability after years of musical chairs with directors
shareholders don't want the company playing musical chairs with their investment
he wrote a textbook on the electrical effects of transposition
she drove but well but her reckless passing of every car on the road frightened me
the gambler demanded a reshuffle
the retraction of the landing gear
retraction of the foreskin
the rotation of the dancer kept time with the music
the golfer went to the driving range to practice his pivot
he gave the crank a spin
it broke off after much twisting
