he went out to have a look
his look was fixed on her eyes
he gave it a good looking at
his camera does his looking for him
he pretended profundity by eye-beamings at people
she shot him an impatient side-glance
he fixed his paternal gaze on me
the platoon stood ready for review
we had to wait for the inspection before we could use the elevator
the monitoring of enemy communications plays an important role in war times
several sightings of enemy troops were reported
he tried to get a better view of it
his survey of the battlefield was limited
they wanted to see violence and they got an eyeful
you can learn a lot by just listening
they make good music--you should give them a hearing
a wine tasting
he received no formal education
our instruction was carefully programmed
good classroom teaching is seldom rewarded
