the cold castle walls were covered with hangings
in Great Britain they used to call a hardware store an ironmonger's shop
the head of the nail", "a pinhead is the head of a pin
the head of the hammer
call heads or tails!
the earphones were held in place by a headband
the general's headquarters were a couple of large tents
many companies have their headquarters in New York
he bought some roach clips and hashish pipes at the head shop
he led the queen of hearts
hearts were trumps
driven from hearth and home
fighting in defense of their firesides
the heating system wasn't working
they have radiant heating
the bathroom could be warmed by an infrared lamp
the hem of her dress was stained
let down the hem
he stitched weights into the curtain's hem
it seeped along the hem of his jacket
