mind your own business
he listened but resented the imposition
his competitor's success was a bitter pill to take
her death was a great grief to John
it was not a good idea
the thought never entered my mind
the taproot of his resentment
genius and insanity spring from the same taproot
Euterpe was his muse
necessity is the mother of invention
divine afflatus
his cogitations were dutifully recorded in his daybook
Luther had a new perception of the Bible
he still holds to the old mumpsimus that a woman's place is in the kitchen
the exam was full of trap questions
it was all a snare and delusion
he has an idea that we don't like him
he was reluctant to make his judgment known
she changed her mind
a decision unfavorable to the opposition
