they struck in support of their claim for a shorter work day
a drain on resources
a drain of young talent by emigration
we took a 10-minute break
he took time out to recuperate
there was a hesitation in his speech
a halt in the arms race
a nuclear freeze
the wait was an ordeal for him
took his repose by the swimming pool
the laziness of the day helped her to relax
their holiday was spent in sleep and vegetation
he lacked the leisure for golf
his forbearance to reply was alarming
he threw himself on the mercy of the court
he puts duty before pleasure
he enjoyed the laughter of the crowd
the satisfaction of their demand for better services
the child was spoiled by overindulgence
an orgy of shopping
