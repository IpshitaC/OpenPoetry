he always arrives on the eve of her departure
Mother's Day
what is the date today?
the date of the election is set by law
the rain date for the picnic will be the following Sunday
he tried to memorizes all the dates for his history class
in the middle ages feria was used with a prefixed ordinal number to designate the day of the week, so `secunda feria' meant Monday, but Sunday and Saturday were always called by their names, Dominicus and Sabbatum, and so feria came to mean an ordinary weekday
the dawn turned night into day
it is easier to make the repairs in the daytime
I spent the morning running errands
he observed a regular lunchtime
he spent a quiet afternoon in the park
he enjoyed the evening light across the lake
he watched television every night
I had a restless night
on the eve of the French Revolution
an evening at the opera
young children should not be allowed to stay up until midnight
we got up before dawn
they talked until morning
