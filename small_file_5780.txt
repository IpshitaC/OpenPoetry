they used face recognition to spot known terrorists
the police made casts of the footprints in the soft earth outside the window
there was footprint evidence that he had been at the scene of the crime
the structure of the iris is very distinctive
identification by retinal scanning is complicated by eye movements
voiceprints are uniquely characteristic of individual speakers
he showed signs of strain
they welcomed the signs of spring
there wasn't a trace of evidence for the claim
a tincture of condescension
the footprints of an earlier civilization
the film provided a valuable record of stage techniques
his effort was testimony to his devotion
I have it on good authority
his easy victory was a testament to his skill
it was a strong argument that his hypothesis was true
he stated his case clearly
she always gets the last word
his gestures provided eloquent reinforcement for his complaints
let faith be your cynosure to walk by
