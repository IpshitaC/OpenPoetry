he had no clear picture of himself or his world
the events left a permanent impression in his mind
I profited from his example
he is the prototype of good breeding
he provided America with an image of the good father
the concentrate of contemporary despair
this painting is a copy of the original
the new policy will be a pacesetter in community relations
the American constitution has provided a pattern for many republics
the Marines are expected to perform prodigies of valor
I tried to describe his appearance to the police
aren't dreams always in 3-D?
he put up a bold front
it happened so fast it was just a blur
he tried to clear his head of the whisky fuzz
the unsoundness of his conclusion was obvious
a circle was the embodiment of his concept of life
he cherished the faith of a good woman
the doctor-patient relationship is based on trust
self-indulgence was his only philosophy
