the policy so far is all stick and no carrot
that villain needs a good horsewhipping
they used cattle prods to administer electric shocks
in those days the hanging of criminals was a public entertainment
Adam was promised immortality in exchange for his disobedience
there was an interchange of prisoners
after a short rally Connors won the point
I faced a tradeoff between eating and buying my medicine
a turf war erupted between street gangs
the president's resignation was the result of a turf war with the board of directors
political crosscurrents disrupted the conference
the teams were in fierce contention for first place
the government was not ready for a confrontation with the unions
the invaders encountered stiff opposition
a fight broke out at the hockey game
there was fighting in the streets
the unhappy couple got into a terrible scrap
the armies met in the shock of battle
I skipped it because it was too much aggro
a blow on the head
