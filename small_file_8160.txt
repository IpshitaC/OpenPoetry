they always sat on the right side of the church
he never left my side
the doctor stood at her bedside
objections were voiced on every hand
the runner was tackled at the line of scrimmage
a good site for the school
the laboratory's floor space
her hand stopped in mid air
he threw the ball into the air
his state is in the deep south
his next stop is Atlanta
there is a stopover to change planes in Chicago
he worked in the coal beds
the diamond fields of South Africa
the corners of a cube
the gardener talked about the proper substrate for acid-loving plants
they skimmed over the surface of the water
a brush small enough to clean every dental surface
the sun has no distinct surface
they were waiting on the first tee
