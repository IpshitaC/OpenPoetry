he was taken aback by such inhospitality
every morning they exchanged polite hellos
he wrote a letter of apology to the hostess
they sent their condolences
the archives provided rich material for a definitive biography
merely a dull rehash of his first novel
after the trial he gave us the real details

Al Smith used to say, `Let's look at the record'
his name is in all the record books
give me the gen on your new line of computers
in a relational database the data are organized as a number of differently sized tables
this business index is computed relative to the base year of 2005
the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the most widely cited indicator of how the stock market is doing
they awaited news of the outcome
it was news to me
we sent out planes to gather intelligence on their radar coverage
have you heard the latest?
his trembling was evidence of his fear
