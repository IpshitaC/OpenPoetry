telomeres act as caps to keep the sticky ends of chromosomes from randomly clumping together
his mind wandered
I couldn't get his words out of my head
use your noddle
he has a special place in my thoughts
a place in my heart

all the reports were out in the open
the facts had been brought to the surface

he has an artist's eye

the servants showed great tact and discretion
he exercised caution in opening the door
he handled the vase with care
