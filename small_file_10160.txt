he studied the shapes of low-viscosity drops
beads of sweat on his forehead
the cannibal's teeth were filed to sharp points
there was a dip in the road
bees filled the waxen cups with honey
he wore a jock strap with a metal cup
the cup of her bra
mandibular notch
there was a sag in the chair seat
his face has many lines
ironing gets rid of most wrinkles
a fold in the napkin
a crease in his trousers
a plication on her blouse
a flexure of the colon
a bend of his elbow
a shapeless mass
the huge desert voids
the emptiness of outer space
without their support he'll be ruling in a vacuum
