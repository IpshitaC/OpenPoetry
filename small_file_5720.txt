without understanding the finer nuances you can't enjoy the humor
don't argue about shades of meaning
overtones of despair
get to the point
he missed the point of the joke
life has lost its point
I think that is a load of cobblers
that's a crock
mere rhetoric
don't give me that stuff
they tried to sell me a bill of goods about a secondhand car
I put up with a lot of bullshit from that jerk
what he said was mostly bull
he searched through piles of letters and clippings
he played the first cut on the cd
the title track of the album
they went to a movie every Saturday night
the film was shot on location
the feature tonight is `Casablanca'
film noir was applied by French critics to describe American thriller or detective films in the 1940s
