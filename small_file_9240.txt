he was the toast of the town
a fellow townsman
a dealer in stolen goods
a homeless tramp
he tried to help the really down-and-out bums
the best student was a transfer from LSU
transient laborers
the traversers slowly ascended the mountain
his trophy wife was an asset to his business
his father was a tyrant
he played uncle to lonely students
he went all over town looking for undersellers
rounding up vagrants and drunks and other undesirables
children are talented undoers of their shoelaces
she awoke in the arms of her cruel undoer
firm upholders of tradition
they are sustainers of the idea of democracy
not all organisms are utilizers of oxygen
the social agencies and their utilizers both objected to the budget cut
a Utopian believes in the ultimate perfectibility of man
