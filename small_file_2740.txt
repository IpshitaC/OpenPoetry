it is a remake of an old film
he lost the remote for his TV
repeaters can be used in computer networks to extend cabling distances
he refused to live in the governor's residence
the gun was steadied on a special rest
the car did not have proper restraints fitted
the reticulation of a leaf
the reticulation of a photographic emulsion
the restoration looked exactly like the original
he lifted the rifle to his shoulder and fired
during the war they turned the bowling alleys into rifle ranges
a square rigger
What a queer rigout!
the ball hit the rim and bounced off
she had rings on every finger
he noted that she wore a wedding band
the rings require a strong upper body
the fuselage cracked along the rivet line
a news reporter has to have a good Rolodex
the rooms were very small but they had a nice view
