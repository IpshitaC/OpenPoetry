Maine is a leading producer of potatoes
this microorganism is a producer of disease
from its creation the plan was doomed to failure
the Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end"--Revelations
the opening received good critical reviews
I was there with my parents at the kickoff
don't argue with the inevitable
bomb tests resulted in the annihilation of the atoll
the dissipation of the mist
the tumor's invasion of surrounding structures
they think a meteor cause the extinction of the dinosaurs
a decrease in the number of automobile fatalities
booze will be the finish of him
it was a fight to the finish
they calibrate the effects of atom bombs in megadeaths
thousands mourned his passing
everyone was aware of the approaching doom but was helpless to avoid it
that's unfortunate but it isn't the end of the world
the ravages of time
the depredations of age and disease
