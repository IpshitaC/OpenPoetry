when you have a monopoly you can ask any price you like
a corner on the silver market
the bane of my life
he is a man who enjoys his comfort
she longed for the comfortableness of her armchair
he enjoyed his relief from responsibility
getting it off his conscience gave him some ease
chairs arranged for his own convenience
the wretchedness for which these prisons became known
the grey wretchedness of the rain
the town was finally on the upbeat after our recent troubles
physicians should be held responsible for the health of their patients
the misery and wretchedness of those slums is intolerable
she satisfied his need for affection
God has no need of men to accomplish His work
there is a demand for jobs
there is a serious lack of insight into the problem
water is the critical deficiency in desert regions
for want of a nail the shoe was lost
the people concerned have a deficit in verbal memory
